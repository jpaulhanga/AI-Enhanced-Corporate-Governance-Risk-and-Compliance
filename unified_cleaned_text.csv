All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, but are not limited to, statements about: • our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin and operating expenses; • maintaining and expanding our customer base and increasing our average subscription revenue per customer; • the impact of competition in our industry and innovation by our competitors; • our anticipated growth and expectations regarding our ability to manage our future growth; • our expectations regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, and the markets in which we and our partners and customers operate; • our anticipated areas of investments, including sales and marketing, research and development, customer service and support, data center infrastructure and service capabilities, and expectations relating to such investments; • our predictions about industry and market trends; • our ability to anticipate and address the evolution of technology and the technological needs of our customers, to roll-out upgrades to our existing software platform and to develop new and enhanced applications to meet the needs of our customers; • our ability to maintain our brand and inbound marketing, selling and servicing thought leadership position; • the impact of our corporate culture and our ability to attract, hire and retain necessary qualified employees to expand our operations; • the anticipated effect on our business of litigation to which we are or may become a party; • our ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies and assets; • our plans regarding declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future; and • our ability to stay abreast of new or modified laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business both in the United States and internationally. 1 We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “HubSpot,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to HubSpot, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 2 Risk Factor Summary The risk factors detailed in Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and a reader should carefully consider them. Those risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. The following is a summary of the risk factors detailed in Item 1A: • The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. • We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future. • We are dependent upon customer renewals, the addition of new customers, increased revenue from existing customers and the continued growth of the market for a CRM Platform. • We face significant competition from both established and new companies offering marketing, sales and customer service software and other related applications, as well as internally developed software, which may harm our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers and grow our business. • Failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing, sales, customer service, and content management capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform. • If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our CRM Platform may become less competitive. • Our ability to introduce new products and features is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed. • Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver our platform to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue. • If our CRM Platform has outages or fails due to defects or similar problems, and if we fail to correct any defect or other software problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs. • If our or our customers’ security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to data of our customers or their customers is otherwise obtained, our CRM Platform may be perceived as not being secure, our customers may be harmed and may curtail or cease their use of our platform, our reputation may be damaged and we may incur significant liabilities. • We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance. • If we do not accurately predict subscription renewal rates or otherwise fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. • Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing. 3 PART 1 ITEM I.

Information contained on or that can be accessed through our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and inclusions of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are inactive textual references only. The HubSpot Approach Our CRM Platform features a central database of lead and customer interactions and integrated applications designed to help businesses attract visitors to their websites, convert visitors into leads, close leads into customers, and delight customers so they become promoters of those businesses. Designed to Help Companies Grow Better. Our CRM Platform was architected from the ground up to enable businesses to transform their marketing, sales, services, and content management playbook to meet the demands of customers today. Our CRM Platform includes both a system of record for maintaining a unified view of the customer experience and a system of engagement for efficiently engaging customers through search engine optimization (“SEO”), web content, social, blogging, email, marketing automation, messaging, support ticketing, knowledge base and more. Ease of Use of a Single, Extensible Platform. We provide a set of integrated applications on a common platform, which offers businesses ease of use and simplicity. Our CRM Platform has one login, one user interface, one database, and one team for support. Our CRM Platform starts free and grows with our customers. It is designed to scale its power and technical sophistication without losing its ease-of-use. In addition to being a comprehensive suite itself, our CRM Platform seamlessly integrates with hundreds of external applications, making it easy to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform and customize it for any business. Power of a Unified Customer View. At the core of our CRM Platform is a single CRM database for each business that captures its lead and customer activity throughout the customer lifecycle. Our CRM Platform creates a unified timeline incorporating all the interactions with a particular customer. In contrast to many CRM suites which are cobbled together, HubSpot has a set of core functionalities, including reporting, content, messaging, data, and automation, which runs across our product lines, which we refer to as Hubs. Scalability. Our CRM Platform was designed and built to serve a large number of customers with demanding use cases. Our CRM Platform currently processes billions of data points each week, and we use leading global cloud infrastructure providers and our own automation technology to dynamically allocate capacity to handle processing workloads of all sizes. We have built our CRM Platform on modern, scalable distributed technologies. We built the infrastructure to support hundreds of microservices and can easily add new features and capabilities to the CRM Platform. We utilize a variety of open-source distributed systems including HBase, Kafka, Vitess, and Elasticsearch to scale our data collection and processing. Our scalability gives us flexibility for future growth and enables us to service a large variety of businesses of different sizes across different industries. Extensible and Open Architecture. Our CRM Platform features a variety of open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that allows easy integration of our platform with other applications. We enable our customers to connect our platform to their other applications, such as ecommerce, event management and videoconferencing applications. By connecting third-party applications, our customers can leverage our centralized inbound database to perform additional functions and analysis. 4 Our Competitive Strengths We believe that our market leadership position is based on the following key strengths: Leading Platform. We have designed and built a world-class CRM Platform. We believe our customers choose our CRM Platform over others because of its powerful, integrated, and easy-to-use applications. We built HubSpot on a single, unified, and intuitive platform, which we believe contrasts positively with many other CRM suites. Market Leadership and Strong Brand. We are a recognized thought leader in the cloud-based marketing, sales, customer service, and content management software industry with a leading brand. Our founders, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, wrote the best-selling marketing book Inbound Marketing: Get Found Using Google, Social Media and Blogs. Our marketing, sales, service, and content management experience attracts, engages, and delights customers by being more relevant, more helpful, more personalized, and less interruptive than traditional marketing and sales tactics. Our INBOUND event is one of the largest inbound industry conference events with registered attendance increasing from 1,100 in 2011 to over 26,000 in 2019. In 2020, we shifted our INBOUND event to a virtual-only experience due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we had more than 70,000 registered attendees. Large and Growing Solutions Partner Program. A Solutions Partner is a service provider that helps businesses with strategy, execution, and implementation of go-to-market activities and technology solutions. Our Solutions Partners promote our brand and offer our CRM Platform to their clients. Solutions Partners and customers referred to us by our Solutions Partners represented approximately 35% of our Total Customers, as defined in our Key Business Metrics in Item 7, as of December 31, 2020, and approximately 43% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. These Solutions Partners help us to promote the vision of the inbound experience, efficiently reach new mid-market businesses at scale, and provide our mutual customers with more diverse and higher-touch services. Freemium Pricing Strategy. Our freemium model attracts customers who begin using our CRM Platform through our free products and then upgrade to our paid Hubs. Through our freemium products, our customers are able to receive value from HubSpot before converting to a paid product or engaging with sales. Mid-Market Focus. We believe we have significant competitive advantages reaching mid-market businesses and efficiently reach this market at scale as a result of our inbound methodology, freemium pricing strategy, and our Solutions Partner channel. Powerful Network Effects. We have built a large and growing ecosystem around our CRM Platform and company. Thousands of our customers integrate third-party applications with our CRM Platform. We believe this ecosystem drives more businesses and professionals to embrace the inbound playbook. As our engaged audience grows, more Solutions Partners collaborate with us, more third-party developers integrate their applications with our CRM Platform, and more professionals complete our certification programs, all of which help to drive more businesses to adopt our CRM Platform. Our Growth Strategy The key elements to our growth strategy are: Grow Our Customer Base. The market for our CRM Platform is large and underserved. Mid-market businesses are particularly underserved by existing point application vendors and often lack sufficient resources to implement complex solutions. Our all-in-one CRM Platform allows mid-market businesses to efficiently adopt and execute an effective inbound marketing, sales, customer service, and content management strategy to help them expand and grow. We will continue to leverage our inbound go-to-market approach, freemium pricing strategy and our network of Solutions Partners to keep growing our business. Increase Revenue from Existing Customers. With 103,994 Total Customers in more than 120 countries spanning many industries, we believe we have a significant opportunity to increase revenue from our existing customers. We plan to increase revenue from our existing customers by expanding their use of our CRM Platform by upselling additional offerings and features, adding additional users, and cross-selling our marketing, sales, service, and content management products to existing customers through touchless or low touch in-product purchases. Our scalable pricing model allows us to capture more spend as our customers grow, increase the number of their customers and prospects managed on our CRM Platform, and offer additional functionality available from our higher price tiers and add-ons, providing us with a substantial opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships. Keep Expanding Internationally. There is a significant opportunity for our CRM Platform outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 50% of our Total Customers were located outside of the United States and these customers generated approximately 43% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We sell to those international customers from our U.S., European, Asia Pacific, and South American based operations. We intend to grow our presence in international markets 5 through additional investments in local sales, marketing and professional service capabilities, as well as by leveraging our Solutions Partner network. We have opened eight international offices and plan to open additional international offices. We have significant website traffic from regions outside the United States, and we believe that markets outside the United States represent a significant growth opportunity. Continue to Innovate and Expand Our CRM Platform. Mid-market businesses are increasingly realizing the value of having an integrated marketing, sales, customer service, and content management platform. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity by introducing new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform. Selectively Pursue Acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and teams that would allow us to add new features and functionalities to our platform and accelerate the pace of our innovation. Our CRM Platform Our CRM Platform features integrated applications and tools that enable companies to create a cohesive and adaptable customer experience. Each Hub can be used standalone or in conjunction with the other Hubs. Our Hubs are available in both free and paid tiers (i.e., Starter, Professional and Enterprise) with gradually increasing levels of functionality that support the needs of our customers as they see success with our tools and their businesses grow. HubSpot CRM The core of our CRM Platform is a single database of lead and customer information that allows businesses to track their interactions with contacts and customers, manage their sales activities, and report on their pipeline and sales. This allows a complete view of lead and customer interactions across all of our integrated Hubs, giving our CRM Platform substantial power. This integration makes it possible to personalize every aspect of the customer interaction across web content, social media engagement, and email messages across devices, including mobile. The integrated Hubs on our CRM Platform have a common user interface and are accessed through a single login. There is a free version of HubSpot CRM that can be used standalone, or with any combination of CMS Hub, Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and/or Service Hub. Marketing Hub Marketing Hub is an all-in-one toolset for marketers to attract, engage, and nurture new leads towards sales readiness over the entire customer lifecycle. Marketing Hub is available in both free and paid tiers, and can be used standalone, with HubSpot CRM, a third party CRM, and/or any version of CMS Hub, Sales Hub or Service Hub. Features include: marketing automation and email, social media, SEO, and reporting and analytics. Sales Hub We designed Sales Hub to enhance the productivity and effectiveness of sales teams. Businesses can empower their teams with tools that deliver a personalized experience for prospects with less work for sales representatives. Sales Hub is available in both free and paid tiers, and can be used with HubSpot CRM, a third party CRM, and/or any version of Marketing Hub, CMS Hub or Service Hub. Features include: email templates and tracking, conversations and live chat, meeting and call scheduling, lead and website visit alerts, sales automation, and lead scoring. Service Hub Service Hub is our customer service software that is designed to help businesses manage and connect with customers. Service Hub is available in free and paid tiers, and can be used standalone, with HubSpot CRM, a third party CRM, and/or any version of Marketing Hub, CMS Hub or Sales Hub. Features include: conversations and live chat functionality, conversational bots, tickets and help desk, automation and routing, knowledge base, team emails, feedback and reporting tools, and customer goals. CMS Hub Our content management system (“CMS”) Hub combines the power of content relationship management and a content management system into one integrated platform. Our content tools enable businesses to create new and edit existing web content while also personalizing their websites for different visitors and optimizing their websites to convert more visitors into leads and customers. CMS Hub can be purchased as a standalone product, with HubSpot CRM, a third party CRM, and/or with any version of Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, or Service Hub. Features include: website pages, business blogging, smart content, landing pages and forms, SEO tools, forms and lead flow, web analytics reporting, calls-to-action, and file manager. 6 Platform Application (“App”) Partners Businesses that use software outside of HubSpot can leverage our ecosystem of third-party integrations. We make it easy to find and install new or existing software solutions that complement our CRM Platform. Over 600 integrations and applications are available for our users, across a wide range of categories, including integrations with leading social media, email, sales, video, analytics, content and webinar tools. Our Services We complement our product offerings with professional services, customer success and support, which we view as critical elements of ensuring the long-term retention of our customers. The majority of our services and support is offered over email, phone, chat applications and via web meeting technology rather than in-person, which is a more efficient business model for us and our customers. Professional Services. We offer professional services to educate and train customers on how to leverage our CRM Platform to transform how their business attracts, engages and delights customers. Depending on which Hubs and services a customer purchases, they receive one-on-one training and guidance from one of our onboarding or technical specialists by web meeting and can purchase additional group training and education in online or in-person classes. Our professional services are also available to customers who need additional assistance on a one-time or ongoing basis for an additional fee. Customer Success. Our customers have access to a Customer Success Manager (“CSM”) or Customer Success Team (“CST”) which are responsible for our customers’ long term success, retention and growth on the HubSpot platform. Our CSMs and CSTs address the unique needs and goals of our customers through a series of ongoing interactions and strategy calls on how to best engage and use our CRM Platform. Support. In addition to assistance provided by our online articles and customer discussion forums, we offer phone and/or email and chat based support, which is included in the cost of a subscription for our Hubs. Phone support is available starting at the Professional product level for all Hubs while email and chat based support is available for Starter Hubs. We strive to maintain an exceptional quality of customer service. We continuously monitor key customer service metrics such as phone hold time, ticket response time and ticket resolution rates, and we monitor the customer satisfaction of our customer support interactions. We believe our customer support is an important reason why businesses choose our CRM Platform and recommend it to their colleagues. Our Total Customers As of December 31, 2020, we had 103,994 Total Customers in more than 120 countries, representing many industries. No single customer represented more than one percent of our revenue in 2020, 2019, or 2018. Our Technology Our Total Customers have chosen us as their CRM Platform, which we architected and built to be secure, highly distributed and highly scalable. Since our founding, we have embraced rapid, iterative product development lifecycles, cloud automation and open-source technologies, including big data platforms, to power marketing, sales, service, and content management programs and provide insights not previously possible or available. Our CRM Platform is a multi-tenant, single code-based, globally available software-as-a-service delivered through APIs, web browsers or mobile applications. Our commitment to a highly available, reliable, and scalable platform for businesses of all sizes is accomplished through the use of these technologies. Platform Approach. We built HubSpot on a single platform with reusable and composable libraries, allowing us to rapidly address new feature areas and bring new products to market that have a consistent user experience and data model. We have built this platform with scale in mind, supporting thousands of components including hundreds of microservices, Modern Database Architecture. We process billions of data points weekly across various channels, including social media, email, SEO and website visits, and continue to drive nearly real-time analytics across these channels. This is possible because we built our database from the ground up using distributed big data technologies such as HBase, Elasticsearch and Kafka to both process and analyze the large amounts of data we collect. We also utilize Vitess to operate MySQL at scale, allowing our engineers to choose the best datastore for each task. Agility. Our infrastructure and development and software release processes allow us to update our platform for specific groups of customers or our entire customer base at any time. This means we can rapidly innovate and deliver new functionality frequently, 7 without waiting for quarterly or annual release cycles. We typically deploy updates to our software platform thousands of times a day, enabling us to gather immediate customer feedback and improve our product quickly and continuously. Cost leverage. Because our CRM Platform was built on an almost exclusive footprint of open-source software and designed to operate in cloud-based data centers, we have benefited from large-scale price reductions by these cloud computing service providers as they continue to innovate and compete for market share. As our processing volume continues to grow, we continue to receive larger volume discounts on a per-unit basis for costs such as storage, bandwidth and computing capacity. We also believe that our extensive use of open-source software will provide additional leverage as we scale our CRM Platform and infrastructure. Scalability. By leveraging leading cloud infrastructure providers along with our automated technology stack, we are able to scale workloads of varying sizes at any time. This allows us to handle customers of all sizes and demands without traditional operational limitations such as network bandwidth, computing cycles, or storage capacity as we can scale our platform on-demand. Reliability. Customer data is distributed and processed across multiple data centers within a region to provide redundancy. We built our CRM platform on a distributed computing architecture with reduced single points of failure and we operate across data center boundaries daily. In addition to datacenter level redundancy, this architecture supports multiple live copies of each data set along with snapshot capabilities for faster, point-in-time data recovery instead of traditional backup and restore methodologies. Security. We leverage industry standard network and perimeter defense technologies, distributed denial-of-service (“DDoS”), protection systems (including web application firewalls) and enterprise grade domain name system (“DNS”), services across multiple vendors. Our data-center providers operate and certify to high industry compliance levels. Due to the broad footprint of our customer base, we regularly test and evaluate our platform with trusted third-party vendors to ensure the security and integrity of our services. Marketing and Sales We believe we are a global leader in implementing an inbound experience in marketing and sales. We believe that our marketing and sales model provides us with a competitive advantage, especially when targeting mid-market businesses, because we can attract and engage these businesses efficiently and at scale. Inbound Marketing. Our marketing team attracts new leads each month through our industry-leading blog and other content, free tools, large social media following, high search engine rankings and personalized website and email content. In addition, we are generating leads for new and add-on product purchases through content and offers delivered through our CRM Platform to existing customers. Inbound Direct Sales. Our sales representatives are based in our offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dublin, Ireland, Sydney, Australia, Singapore, Tokyo, Japan, Berlin, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogotá, Columbia, and use phone, email, and web meetings to interact with prospects and customers. The majority of revenue generated by our sales representatives originates with inbound leads produced by our marketing efforts. In addition, through our freemium products and in-product cross-sell offerings, we close new business with little or no interaction by our sales representatives. Inbound Channel Sales. In addition to our direct sales team, we have sales representatives that manage relationships with our worldwide network of Solutions Partners who both use our platform for their own businesses and also, on a commissioned basis, refer customers to us. These Solutions Partners collaborate with us not only to leverage our software platform and educational resources, but also to build their own business by offering new services and shifting their revenue mix to include recurring revenue streams. COVID-19 Pandemic In March 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a global pandemic (the “pandemic”). This pandemic is having widespread, rapidly-evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. While the pandemic has not had a material adverse financial impact on our business to date, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance will depend on future developments and conditions. We are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic and developments related thereto and our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers, and ensuring business continuity. For discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report. 8 Human Capital Management Helping millions of organizations grow better requires a truly remarkable team. We are passionate about building a company culture where people can do their best work. Our company culture and our people are not just human resources priorities but critical business priorities. As a result, we consistently focus on how we can continue to help employees grow, both personally and professionally. Since 2012, we have expanded beyond our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters to several offices globally and have built a large remote community. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,225 full-time employees, or HubSpotters. Of these, 2,813 are in North and Latin America, 1,082 are in Europe, and 330 are in the Asia Pacific region. • Culture and Values. Our award-winning culture is built on the firm belief that personal and professional growth is just as important as business growth. We believe the best people do not only fit our culture, they further it. In 2013, we published the HubSpot Culture Code, which outlines our core company values, including transparency, autonomy, flexibility, and HEART. HEART is at the center of who we are and represents the five traits we value the most in HubSpotters: Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable and Transparent. The Culture Code has garnered more than five million views and is a top reason candidates say they are drawn to working at HubSpot. A copy of our Culture Code can be found at: https://network.hubspot.com/slides/the-hubspot-culture-code. • Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. We have launched various initiatives to further our goal of being a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace. We have a team dedicated to diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives, including but not limited to: hiring goals focused on increasing black, indigenous and people of color representation company-wide, anti-racism training for employees and managers, key external partnerships, and our annual diversity report. In addition, we have numerous active employee resource groups, including Women@HubSpot, People of Color at HubSpot, BLACKhub, the LGBTQ+ Alliance, and Families@HubSpot, as well as a variety of interest groups globally including age inclusion, ability and accessibility, and veterans. • Compensation and Benefits. We provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees globally. Our compensation packages may include base salary, commission or semi-annual bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We also offer general employee medical and dental plans, unlimited vacation, life and disability insurance, and Section 401(k) plan matching contributions designed to provide employee benefits competitive with those offered by our peers and other companies with which we compete for talent. In addition, we offer an employee stock purchase plan, under which eligible employees can voluntarily opt in to buy HubSpot common stock at a discount from the fair market value of the stock as determined on specific dates twice a year. We evaluate both compensation and benefit offerings on an annual basis to ensure competitiveness of both programs and we make adjustments as needed. • Workplace awards. We are proud to be named a Best Place to Work in 2020 and 2021 by Glassdoor. We have also been recognized as a top workplace in 2020 by Great Place to Work, the Boston Globe, the Boston Business Journal, and more. We are also honored in a number of categories by Comparably's workplace awards in 2020 including Best CEOs, Best Companies for Women, Best Companies for Diversity, Best Overall Company Culture, and a Best Company for Employee Happiness. • Hybrid Culture and COVID-19. Like other companies, we have learned to adapt during the pandemic. We have prioritized employee safety and transparency during the pandemic and continue to do so, ensuring all employees are set up to work remotely and providing clarity on office closures and evolving guidelines, where possible. In the third quarter of 2020, we made the decision to permanently move to a hybrid workplace model, which means that as of January 1, 2021, our employees will have the option to be fully remote, work full-time from one of our offices, or have the flexibility to work between office and remotely. This move provides our employees with continued flexibility, following the pandemic, to work in person, remotely, or in a hybrid model. This will enable us to grow better in serving our customers. Competition Our market is evolving, highly competitive and fragmented, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are: o vision for the market, product strategy and pace of innovation; o inbound marketing focus and domain expertise; o integrated all-in-one CRM Platform; o breadth and depth of product functionality; 9 o ease of use; o scalable, open architecture; o time to value and total cost of ownership; o integration with third-party applications and data sources; o name recognition and brand reputation; and o “freemium” go-to-market motion. We believe we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. We face intense competition from other software companies that develop marketing, sales, service, and content management software. Our competitors offer various point applications that provide certain functions and features that we provide, including: o cloud-based marketing automation providers; o content management systems; o email marketing software vendors; o sales force automation and CRM software vendors o customer service platform vendors; and o large-scale enterprise suites. In addition, instead of using our CRM Platform, some prospective customers may elect to combine disparate point applications, such as content management, marketing automation, analytics, social media management, ticketing, and conversational bots. We expect that we will develop and introduce, or acquire, applications serving customer-facing and other front office functions. Intellectual Property Our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our technology, will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We protect our intellectual property through trade secrets law, copyrights, trademarks, patents, and contracts. Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property. We have 3 issued U.S. Patents, 2 allowed patent pending issuance, 7 U.S. utility patents applications pending, and 2 provisional patents filed. We intend to pursue and are pursuing additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. In addition to the foregoing, we have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, and companies with which we conduct business. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective intellectual property, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Financial Information About Segments We operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is our chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The CODM evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. See Footnote 10 within the consolidated financial statements for information by geographic area.

RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”), was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, (the “pandemic”). The pandemic, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. Our operations have also been impacted by a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control. For example, many cities, counties, states, and even countries have imposed or may impose a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees, partners and customers to limit the spread of the pandemic, including physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential business, quarantines, work-from-home directives, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on public gatherings. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. In March 2020, we temporarily closed our global offices, including our corporate headquarters, suspended all company-related travel, and all HubSpot employees globally were required to work from home for several months during the height of the pandemic. We shifted our Solutions Partner events and INBOUND 2020 to virtual-only experiences and have cancelled other customer and industry events. Although we have begun to slowly re-open our offices on a staggered, region-by-region basis in accordance with local authority guidelines, we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. All of these changes may disrupt the way we operate our business. Given that the economic consequences of the pandemic have been exceptionally challenging for many of our customers and prospects, we have also implemented certain changes to our pricing structure, including reducing prices on our Starter Growth Suite, offering certain product functionality free of charge for a limited time, suspending marketing email send limits for a limited time, and offering a one-time six-month advance on commissions to certain of our Solutions Partners. Moreover, the conditions caused by the pandemic may affect the rate of spending on software products and may adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our offerings; the timing of our current or prospective customers’ purchasing decisions; pricing discounts or extended payment terms; reductions in the amount or duration of customers’ subscription contracts; or increase customer attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance. If the pandemic has a substantial impact on the ability of our customers to purchase our offerings, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. The duration and extent of the impact from the pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the disruption caused by such actions, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including, in particular, risks related to our dependence on customer renewals, the addition of new customers and increased revenue from existing customer, risks that our operating results could be negatively affected by changes in the sizes or types of businesses that purchase our platform and the risk that weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations. 12 We are dependent upon customer renewals, the addition of new customers, increased revenue from existing customers and the continued growth of the market for a CRM Platform. We derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our CRM Platform. The market for inbound marketing, sales and customer service products is still evolving, and competitive dynamics may cause pricing levels to change as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of point applications and different approaches to enable businesses to address their respective needs. As a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our platform and may be unable to renew existing customer agreements or enter into new customer agreements at the same prices and upon the same terms that we have historically. In addition, our growth strategy involves a scalable pricing model (including freemium versions of our products) intended to provide us with an opportunity to increase the value of our customer relationships over time as we expand their use of our platform, sell to other parts of their organizations, cross-sell our sales products to existing marketing product customers and vice versa through touchless or low touch in product purchases, and upsell additional offerings and features. If our cross-selling efforts are unsuccessful or if our existing customers do not expand their use of our platform or adopt additional offerings and features, our operating results may suffer. Our subscription renewal rates may decrease, and any decrease could harm our future revenue and operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our platform after the expiration of their subscription periods, substantially all of which are one year or less. In addition, our customers may seek to renew for lower subscription tiers, for fewer contacts or seats, or for shorter contract lengths. Also, customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions for a variety of reasons. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including limited customer resources, pricing changes, the prices of services offered by our competitors, adoption and utilization of our platform and add-on applications by our customers, adoption of our new products, customer satisfaction with our platform, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers’ spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or decrease the amount they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. In addition, a subscription model creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash flows. A portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. We face significant competition from both established and new companies offering marketing, sales and customer service software and other related applications, as well as internally developed software, which may harm our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers and grow our business. The marketing, sales, customer service, and content management software market is evolving, highly competitive and significantly fragmented. With the introduction of new technologies and the potential entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase renewals and maintain our prices. We face intense competition from other software companies that develop marketing, sales, customer service, and content management software and from marketing services companies that provide interactive marketing services. Competition could significantly impede our ability to sell subscriptions to our CRM Platform on terms favorable to us. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products less competitive, or obsolete. In addition, if these competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality to our platform, we may need to decrease the prices or accept less favorable terms for our platform subscriptions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins will be reduced and our operating results will be negatively affected. Our competitors include: • cloud-based marketing automation providers; • email marketing software vendors; • sales force automation and CRM software vendors; • large-scale enterprise suites; • customer service software providers; and • content management systems. 13 In addition, instead of using our platform, some prospective customers may elect to combine disparate point applications, such as content management, marketing automation, CRM, analytics and social media management. We expect that new competitors, such as enterprise software vendors that have traditionally focused on enterprise resource planning or other applications supporting back office functions, will develop and introduce applications serving customer-facing and other front office functions. This development could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, sales force automation and CRM vendors could acquire or develop applications that compete with our marketing software offerings. Some of these companies have acquired social media marketing and other marketing software providers to integrate with their broader offerings. Our current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, and may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may respond faster to new technologies and undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their products. In a few cases, these vendors may also be able to offer marketing, sales, customer service and content management software at little or no additional cost by bundling it with their existing suite of applications. To the extent any of our competitors has existing relationships with potential customers for either marketing software or other applications, those customers may be unwilling to purchase our platform because of their existing relationships with our competitor. If we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our CRM Platform could substantially decline. In addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be adversely affected. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic distribution and technology partners or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote and implement our platform. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We have experienced rapid growth and organizational change in recent periods and expect continued future growth. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately. Our head count and operations have grown substantially. For example, we had 4,225 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020, as compared with 3,387 as of December 31, 2019 and we have opened 8 international offices since 2012. We also plan to open additional offices in the future. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate further growth will be required to address increases in our product offerings and continued expansion. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to recruit, hire, train, manage and integrate a significant number of qualified managers, technical personnel and employees in specialized roles within our company, including in technology, sales and marketing. Furthermore, preservation of our corporate culture has been made more difficult as our work force has been working from home in connection with restrictions placed upon businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A long-term continuation of these restrictions could, among other things, negatively impact employee morale and productivity. Any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. If we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, if our new employees perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in recruiting, hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or retaining these or our existing employees, it could materially impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our platform, all of which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to manage the expected continued growth of our head count, operations and geographic expansion, we will need to continue to improve our information technology infrastructure, operational, financial and management systems and procedures. Our anticipated additional head count and capital investments will increase our costs, which will make it more difficult for us to address any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to successfully execute our business plan, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing, sales, customer service, and content management capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform. To increase Total Customers and achieve broader market acceptance of our CRM Platform, we will need to expand our marketing, sales, customer service and content management operations, including our sales force and third-party channel partners. We will continue to dedicate significant resources to inbound sales and marketing programs. The effectiveness of our inbound sales and marketing and third-party channel partners has varied over time and may vary in the future and depends on our ability to maintain and improve our CRM Platform. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. Our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated 14 revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective. The rate of growth of our business depends on the continued participation and level of service of our Solutions Partners. We rely on our Solutions Partners to provide certain services to our customers, as well as pursue sales of our CRM Platform to customers. To the extent we do not attract new Solutions Partners, or existing or new Solutions Partners do not refer a growing number of customers to us, our revenue and operating results would be harmed. In addition, if our Solutions Partners do not continue to provide services to our customers, we would be required to provide such services ourselves either by expanding our internal team or engaging other third-party providers, which would increase our operating costs. If we fail to maintain our inbound thought leadership position, our business may suffer. We believe that maintaining our thought leadership position in inbound marketing, sales, services and content management is an important element in attracting new customers. We devote significant resources to develop and maintain our thought leadership position, with a focus on identifying and interpreting emerging trends in the inbound experience, shaping and guiding industry dialog and creating and sharing the best inbound practices. Our activities related to developing and maintaining our thought leadership may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in such effort. We rely upon the continued services of our management and employees with domain expertise with inbound marketing, sales, services, and content management, and the loss of any key employees in this area could harm our competitive position and reputation. If we fail to successfully grow and maintain our thought leadership position, we may not attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers, and our business could suffer. If we fail to further enhance our brand and maintain our existing strong brand awareness, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our financial condition may suffer. We believe that our development of the HubSpot brand is critical to achieving widespread awareness of our existing and future inbound experience solutions, and, as a result, is important to attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expenses, and we believe that this investment has resulted in strong brand recognition in the B2B market. Successful promotion and maintenance of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide a reliable and useful CRM Platform at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer. If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our CRM Platform may become less competitive. Our future success depends on our ability to adapt and innovate our CRM Platform. To attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers, we need to continue to enhance and improve our offerings to meet customer needs at prices that our customers are willing to pay. Such efforts will require adding new functionality and responding to technological advancements, which will increase our research and development costs. If we are unable to develop new applications that address our customers’ needs, or to enhance and improve our platform in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market acceptance of our platform. Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. Access and use of our CRM Platform is provided via the cloud, which, itself, was disruptive to the previous enterprise software model. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver inbound marketing software and related applications at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely affect our ability to compete. If we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation may suffer. High-quality education, training and customer support are important for the successful marketing, sale and use of our CRM Platform and for the renewal of existing customers. Providing this education, training and support requires that our personnel who manage our online training resource, HubSpot Academy, or provide customer support have specific inbound experience domain knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers use multiple applications within our CRM Platform and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional functionality and services to, or to retain, existing customers may suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed. 15 We may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers’ growing needs and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed. As usage of our CRM Platform grows and as customers use our platform for additional inbound applications, such as sales and services, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating with third-party systems and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and professional services, to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer demographics change over time. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our CRM Platform to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could impede our revenue growth and harm our reputation. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management’s time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely affect our financial results. Our ability to introduce new products and features is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop new product offerings, applications, features and enhancements to our existing CRM Platform. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop our platform internally due to certain constraints, such as high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors’ research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could materially adversely affect our business. Changes in the sizes or types of businesses that purchase our platform or in the applications within our CRM Platform purchased or used by our customers could negatively affect our operating results. Our strategy is to sell subscriptions to our CRM Platform to mid-sized businesses, but we have sold and will continue to sell to organizations ranging from small businesses to enterprises. Our gross margins can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our CRM Platform, including the sophistication and intensity of our customers’ use of our platform and the level of professional services and support required by a customer. Sales to enterprise customers may entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts. Selling to small businesses may involve greater credit risk and uncertainty. If there are changes in the mix of businesses that purchase our platform or the mix of the product plans purchased by our customers, our gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected. We have in the past completed acquisitions and may acquire or invest in other companies or technologies in the future, which could divert management’s attention, fail to meet our expectations, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations or harm our operating results. We have in the past acquired, and we may in the future acquire or invest in, businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities, for example, the acquisition of PieSync in 2019. We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these or any future acquisitions. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. There are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to assimilate or integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition and our management may be distracted from operating our business. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including: unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; incurrence of acquisition-related costs, which would be recognized as a current period expense; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our platform and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to integrate or implement additional controls, procedures and policies; challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; harm to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition; the potential loss of key 16 employees; use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business and diversion of management and employee resources; the inability to recognize acquired deferred revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies; and use of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition. Acquisitions also increase the risk of unforeseen legal liability, including for potential violations of applicable law or industry rules and regulations, arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired businesses which are not discovered by due diligence during the acquisition process. Generally, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not ultimately yield expected returns, we may be required to make charges to our operating results based on our impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations. Because our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to customers outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations. A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. We have opened 8 international offices since 2012. We also plan to open additional offices in the future. These international offices focus primarily on sales, professional services and support. We also have a development team in Dublin, Ireland. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including: • difficulties in maintaining our company culture with a dispersed and distant workforce; • more stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws; • differing labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations; • challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs; • difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems; • currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future; • global economic uncertainty caused by global political events, including the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, on January 31, 2020, or ""Brexit"", and similar geopolitical developments; • limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries; • limited or insufficient intellectual property protection; • political instability or terrorist activities; • likelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, or of U.S. and international export control and sanctions regulations, which likelihood may increase with an increase of sales or operations in foreign jurisdictions and operations in certain industries; and • adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash. Our limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will suffer. We continue to implement policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to or arising from our international business. Inadequacies in our past or current compliance practices may increase the risk of inadvertent violations of such laws and regulations, which could lead to financial and other penalties that could damage our reputation and impose costs on us. 17 Risks Related to Employee Matters If we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed. We believe that a critical component to our success has been our company culture, which is based on transparency and personal autonomy. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team within this company culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow as and continue to develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our company culture. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business may be adversely impacted. We rely on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business. Our success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team, including our co-founders, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, and other key employees in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services, content management, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers and information technology personnel because of the complexity of our platform, technologies and infrastructure. We may terminate any employee’s employment at any time, with or without cause, and any employee may resign at any time, with or without cause. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel. The loss of one or more of our key employees could harm our business. The failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy. To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled information technology, marketing, sales and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. Also, inbound sales, marketing, services, and content management domain experts are very important to our success and are difficult to replace. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In particular, we have experienced a competitive hiring environment in the Greater Boston area, where we are headquartered. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed. Risks Related to Our Technical Operations Infrastructure and Dependence on Third Parties Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver our platform to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue. We currently serve the majority of our platform functions from third-party data center hosting facilities operated by Amazon Web Services located in northern Virginia and Google Cloud Platform located in Frankfurt, Germany. In addition, we serve ancillary functions for our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities operated by Rackspace located in Dallas, Texas, with a backup facility in Chicago, Illinois. Our operations depend, in part, on our third-party facility providers’ abilities to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that any of our third-party facilities arrangements is terminated, or if there is a lapse of service or damage to a facility, we could experience interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems of our third-party providers could result in interruptions to our platform. Despite precautions taken at our data centers, the occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, such as earthquakes or hurricane, an act of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close a facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our on-demand software. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause customers to fail to renew their subscriptions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. 18 If our CRM Platform has outages or fails due to defects or similar problems, and if we fail to correct any defect or other software problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs. Our platform and its underlying infrastructure are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. We release modifications, updates, bug fixes and other changes to our software several times per day, without traditional human-performed quality control reviews for each release. We have from time to time found defects in our software and may discover additional defects in the future. We may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before customers begin to use our platform or its applications. Consequently, we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our platform has been implemented. For example, in March 2019, we had a product outage due to the failure of one of the infrastructure systems that supports multiple parts of our platform. Although no data from prior to the outage was lost, our customers experienced disruptions in using our platform during the outage. Defects or errors could result in product outages and could also cause inaccuracies in the data we collect and process for our customers, or even the loss, damage or inadvertent release of such confidential data. We implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regular system maintenance, which may lead to system downtime. Even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any history of product outages, defects or inaccuracies in the data we collect for our customers, or the loss, damage or inadvertent release of confidential data could cause our reputation to be harmed, and customers may elect not to purchase or renew their agreements with us. Furthermore, these issues could subject us to service performance credits (whether offered by us or required by contract), warranty claims or increased insurance costs. The costs associated with product outages, any material defects or errors in our platform or other performance problems may be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, third-party apps and features on our CRM Platform may not meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts and, to the extent they contain bugs, vulnerabilities or defects, they may create disruptions in our customers’ use of our products, lead to data loss, unauthorized access to customer data, damage our brand and reputation and affect the continued use of our products, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are dependent on the continued availability of third-party data hosting and transmission services. A significant portion of our operating cost is from our third-party data hosting and transmission services. If the costs for such services increase due to vendor consolidation, regulation, contract renegotiation, or otherwise, we may not be able to increase the fees for our CRM Platform or services to cover the changes. As a result, our operating results may be significantly worse than forecasted. If we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our CRM Platform with third-party applications that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue will decline. A significant percentage of our customers choose to integrate our platform with certain capabilities provided by third-party application providers using application programming interfaces (“APIs”) published by these providers. The functionality and popularity of our CRM Platform depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our platform with third-party applications and platforms, including CRM, CMS, e-commerce, call center, analytics and social media sites that our customers use and from which they obtain data. Third-party providers of applications and APIs may change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms, or alter the terms governing use of their applications and APIs and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our platform, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our platform with new third-party applications and platforms that our customers use for marketing, sales, services or content management purposes, or fail to renew existing relationships pursuant to which we currently provide such integration, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate new revenue or maintain existing revenue and adversely impact our business. 19 We rely on data provided by third parties, the loss of which could limit the functionality of our platform and disrupt our business. Select functionality of our CRM Platform depends on our ability to deliver data, including search engine results and social media updates, provided by unaffiliated third parties, such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter. Some of this data is provided to us pursuant to third-party data sharing policies and terms of use, under data sharing agreements by third-party providers or by customer consent. In the future, any of these third parties could change its data sharing policies, including making them more restrictive, or alter its algorithms that determine the placement, display, and accessibility of search results and social media updates, any of which could result in the loss of, or significant impairment to, our ability to collect and provide useful data to our customers. These third parties could also interpret our, or our service providers’, data collection policies or practices as being inconsistent with their policies, which could result in the loss of our ability to collect this data for our customers. Any such changes could impair our ability to deliver data to our customers and could adversely impact select functionality of our platform, impairing the return on investment that our customers derive from using our solution, as well as adversely affecting our business and our ability to generate revenue. Privacy concerns and end users’ acceptance of Internet behavior tracking may limit the applicability, use and adoption of our CRM Platform. Privacy concerns may cause end users to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our platform effectively. We have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better protect end user privacy, but these measures may not alleviate all potential privacy concerns and threats. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform, especially in certain industries that rely on sensitive personal information. Privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by these groups’ policies and actions may limit the use and adoption of our CRM Platform and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance or loss of any such action. If our or our customers’ security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to data of our customers or their customers is otherwise obtained, our CRM Platform may be perceived as not being secure, our customers may be harmed and may curtail or cease their use of our platform, our reputation may be damaged and we may incur significant liabilities. Our operations involve the storage and transmission of data of our customers and their customers, including personally identifiable information. Our storage is typically the sole source of record for portions of our customers’ businesses and end user data, such as initial contact information and online interactions. Security incidents could result in unauthorized access to, loss of or unauthorized disclosure of this information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales and harm our customers and our business. Cyber-attacks and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and cloud-based platform providers of marketing services have been targeted. If our security measures are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liability. If third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, violate applicable laws, our security policies or our acceptable use policy, such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if the security measures of our customers are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches to us or our systems. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems or gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data. Additionally, we provide extensive access to our database, which stores our customer data, to our development team to facilitate our rapid pace of product development. If such access or our own operations cause the loss, damage or destruction of our customers’ business data, their sales, lead generation, support and other business operations may be permanently harmed. As a result, our customers may bring claims against us for lost profits and other damages. Our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators, vendors, and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Cyber incidents have been increasing in sophistication and frequency and can include third parties gaining access to employee or customer data using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, ransomware, card skimming code, and other deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. 20 If we were to experience a cyberattack and suffer interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other disruptions. These cyber-attacks could be carried out by threat actors of all types (including but not limited to nation states, organized crime, other criminal enterprises, individual actors and/or advanced persistent threat groups). In addition, we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by any of these threat actors. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our competitive position could be harmed. Any breach, loss, or compromise of personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties, or claims for damages either under the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and relevant member state law in the European Union, other foreign laws, and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the United States. Many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents or unauthorized transfers involving certain types of personal data. In addition, some of our customers contractually require notification of any data security compromise. Security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Intellectual Property Our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others. The software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual and proprietary rights. Companies in the software industry, including those in marketing software, are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents and/or have filed patent applications and may assert patent or other intellectual property rights within the industry. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups that are non-practicing entities, commonly referred to as “patent trolls,” have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements. From time to time, we may receive threatening letters or notices or may be the subject of claims that our services and/or platform and underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand and cause us to incur significant expenses. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to redesign our application, delay releases, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our platform. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our customers may not purchase our CRM Platform if they are concerned that they may infringe third-party intellectual property rights. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. In our subscription agreements with our customers, we generally do not agree to indemnify our customers against any losses or costs incurred in connection with claims by a third party alleging that a customer’s use of our services or platform infringes the intellectual property rights of the third party. There can be no assurance, however, that customers will not assert a common law indemnity claim or that any existing limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate, or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Our customers who are accused of intellectual property infringement may in the future seek indemnification from us under common law or other legal theories. If such claims are successful, or if we are required to indemnify or defend our customers from these or other claims, these matters could be disruptive to our business and management and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 21 If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, in the United States and abroad, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, experience reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights. Our success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our offerings may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our technology and proprietary information may increase. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform and offerings. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform and offerings, impair the functionality of our platform and offerings, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform and offerings, or injure our reputation. Our use of “open source” software could negatively affect our ability to offer our platform and subject us to possible litigation. A substantial portion of our cloud-based platform incorporates so-called “open source” software, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Open source software is generally freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source licenses may, in certain circumstances, require us to offer the components of our platform that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from the offering of the components of our platform that contained the open source software and being required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt our ability to offer the affected software. We could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. Risks Related to Government Regulation We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various state, local and foreign agencies. We collect personally identifiable information and other data from our customers and leads. We also handle personally identifiable information about our customers’ customers. We use this information to provide services to our customers, to support, expand and improve our business. We may also share customers’ personally identifiable information with third parties as authorized by the customer or as described in our privacy policy. The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying 22 federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use and dissemination of data. However, these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security are evolving, and changes to such laws and regulations could require us to change features of our platform or restrict our customers’ ability to collect and use email addresses, page viewing data and personal information, which may reduce demand for our platform. Our failure to comply with federal, state and international data privacy laws and regulations could harm our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that, among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA recently was amended and it is not yet fully clear how the CCPA will be enforced and how certain of its requirements will be interpreted. We cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed in November 2020. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The effects of the CCPA and the CPRA are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation. Certain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations and we also expect anticipate that more states to may enact legislation similar to the CCPA, which provides consumers with new privacy rights and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information of such consumers. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. In addition, several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada, have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents, which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual. In relevant part, these laws and regulations may affect our ability to engage in lead generation activities by imposing heightened requirements, such as affirmative opt-ins or consent prior to sending commercial correspondence or engaging in electronic tracking activities. For example, a recent ruling of the European Court of Justice in Case C-673/17 provides that a pre-checked opt-in is insufficient to constitute a valid active consumer consent to cookie storage. Within the European Union, legislators have adopted the GDPR and which became effective in May 2018 which may impose additional obligations and risk upon our business and which may increase substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. In addition, further to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain United Kingdom specific amendments) into United Kingdom law (the “UK GDPR”). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The United Kingdom, however, is now regarded as a third country under the European Union’s GDPR which means that transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area to the United Kingdom will be restricted unless an appropriate safeguard, as recognized by the European Union’s GDPR, has been put in place. However, under the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement it is lawful to transfer personal data between the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area for a 6 month period following the end of the transition period, with a view to achieving an adequacy decision from the European Commission during that period. Like the European Union GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the United Kingdom to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection (this means that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the European Economic Area remain free flowing). On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted the EU-US Privacy Shield, a framework for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States, as a successor to the Safe Harbor framework that was invalidated by the European Court of Justice in October 2015. We certified to the EU-US Privacy Shield. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice 23 invalidated the EU–US Privacy Shield ruling that it failed to offer adequate protections for European Union personal data transferred to the United States. The European Court of Justice, in the same decision, deemed that the Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal data between European Union controllers and non-European Union processors are valid, however the European Court of Justice deemed that transfers made pursuant to the SCCs need to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis to ensure the European Union’s standards of data protection are met. Our customer agreements include SCCs. However, as a result of this decision, companies may be required to adopt additional measures to accomplish transfers of personal data to the United States and other third countries in compliance with the GDPR, and there continue to be concerns about whether the SCCs will face additional challenges. Until the remaining legal uncertainties regarding how to legally continue these transfers are settled, we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our customers will be permitted to transfer personal data to the United States for processing by us as part of our platform services. If such data transfer to the United States is not permitted, it could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new customers. Our customers may view alternative data transfer mechanisms as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. For example, some of our customers or potential customers who do business in the European Union may require their vendors to host all personal data within the European Union and may decide to do business with one of our competitors who hosts personal data within the European Union instead of doing business with us. The regulatory framework governing the collection, processing, storage, use and sharing of certain information, particularly financial and other personal information, is rapidly evolving and is likely to continue to be subject to uncertainty and varying interpretations. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or any third parties with which we do business, to comply with our posted privacy policies, changing consumer expectations, evolving laws, rules and regulations, industry standards, or contractual obligations to which we or such third parties are or may become subject, may result in actions or other claims against us by governmental entities or private actors, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources or the incurrence of significant fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, any such action, particularly to the extent we were found to be guilty of violations or otherwise liable for damages, would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We publicly post documentation regarding our practices concerning the collection, processing, use and disclosure of data. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or any applicable privacy, security or data protection, information security or consumer-protection related laws, regulations, orders or industry standards could expose us to costly litigation, significant awards, fines or judgments, civil and/or criminal penalties or negative publicity, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The publication of our privacy policy and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, which could, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to claims, legal proceedings or other actions by individuals or governmental authorities based on privacy or data protection regulations and our commitments to customers or others, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our subscribers’ ability to use and share personal information or our ability to store, process and share personal information, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. We could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of the activities of our customers, the content of their websites or the data they store on our servers. As a provider of a cloud-based inbound marketing, sales and customer service software platform, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with the data they store on our servers. Although our customer terms of use prohibit illegal use of our services by our customers and permit us to take down websites or take other appropriate actions for illegal use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law or the customer’s own policies, which could subject us to liability or harm our reputation. Furthermore, customers may upload, store, or use content on our CRM Platform that may violate our policy on acceptable use which prohibits content that is threatening, abusive, harassing, deceptive, false, misleading, vulgar, obscene, or indecent. While such content may not be illegal, use of our CRM Platform for such content could harm our reputation resulting in a loss of business. Several U.S. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to various customer activities: • The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, or DMCA, provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet. Under the DMCA, based on our 24 current business activity as an Internet service provider that does not own or control website content posted by our customers, we generally are not liable for infringing content posted by our customers or other third parties, provided that we follow the procedures for handling copyright infringement claims set forth in the DMCA. Generally, if we receive a proper notice from, or on behalf, of a copyright owner alleging infringement of copyrighted material located on websites we host, and we fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the safe harbor provided by the DMCA, the copyright owner may seek to impose liability on us. Technical mistakes in complying with the detailed DMCA take-down procedures could subject us to liability for copyright infringement. • The Communications Decency Act of 1996, or CDA, generally protects online service providers, such as us, from liability for certain activities of their customers, such as the posting of defamatory or obscene content, unless the online service provider is participating in the unlawful conduct. Under the CDA, we are generally not responsible for the customer-created content hosted on our servers. Consequently, we do not monitor hosted websites or prescreen the content placed by our customers on their sites. However, the CDA does not apply in foreign jurisdictions and we may nonetheless be brought into disputes between our customers and third parties which would require us to devote management time and resources to resolve such matters and any publicity from such matters could also have an adverse effect on our reputation and therefore our business. • In addition to the CDA, the Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act, or the SPEECH Act, provides a statutory exception to the enforcement by a U.S. court of a foreign judgment for defamation under certain circumstances. Generally, the exception applies if the defamation law applied in the foreign court did not provide at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press as would be provided by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or by the constitution and law of the state in which the U.S. court is located, or if no finding of defamation would be supported under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or under the constitution and law of the state in which the U.S. court is located. Although the SPEECH Act may protect us from the enforcement of foreign judgments in the United States, it does not affect the enforceability of the judgment in the foreign country that issued the judgment. Given our international presence, we may therefore, nonetheless, have to defend against or comply with any foreign judgments made against us, which could take up substantial management time and resources and damage our reputation. Although these statutes and case law in the United States have generally shielded us from liability for customer activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. In addition, laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible for us to comply with in some international jurisdictions. Also, notwithstanding the exculpatory language of these bodies of law, we may become involved in complaints and lawsuits which, even if ultimately resolved in our favor, add cost to our doing business and may divert management’s time and attention. Finally, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various states, may be deemed to apply or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future, any of which could expose us to further liability and increase our costs of doing business. The standards that private entities use to regulate the use of email have in the past interfered with, and may in the future interfere with, the effectiveness of our CRM Platform and our ability to conduct business. Our customers rely on email to communicate with their existing or prospective customers. Various private entities attempt to regulate the use of email for commercial solicitation. These entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain email solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as spam. Some of these entities maintain “blacklists” of companies and individuals, and the websites, internet service providers and internet protocol addresses associated with those entities or individuals that do not adhere to those standards of conduct or practices for commercial email solicitations that the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate. If a company’s internet protocol addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity, emails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any internet domain or internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity’s service or purchases its blacklist. From time to time, some of our internet protocol addresses may become listed with one or more blacklisting entities due to the messaging practices of our customers. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully remove ourselves from those lists. Blacklisting of this type could interfere with our ability to market our CRM Platform and services and communicate with our customers and, because we fulfill email delivery on behalf of our customers, could undermine the effectiveness of our customers’ email marketing campaigns, all of which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations. 25 Existing federal, state and foreign laws regulate Internet tracking software, the senders of commercial emails and text messages, website owners and other activities, and could impact the use of our CRM Platform and potentially subject us to regulatory enforcement or private litigation. Certain aspects of how our customers utilize our platform are subject to regulations in the United States, European Union and elsewhere. In recent years, U.S. and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over the use of third-party cookies or web beacons for online behavioral advertising, and legislation adopted recently in the European Union requires informed consent for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device. Regulation of cookies and web beacons may lead to restrictions on our activities, such as efforts to understand users’ Internet usage. New and expanding “Do Not Track” regulations have recently been enacted or proposed that protect users’ right to choose whether or not to be tracked online. These regulations seek, among other things, to allow end users to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with their choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third party websites. These policies could have a significant impact on the operation of our CRM Platform and could impair our attractiveness to customers, which would harm our business. Many of our customers and potential customers in the healthcare, financial services and other industries are subject to substantial regulation regarding their collection, use and protection of data and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. Accordingly, these laws or significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and may require us to implement additional features or offer additional contractual terms to satisfy customer and regulatory requirements, or could cause the demand for and sales of our CRM Platform to decrease and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act, establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. The CAN-SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender. The ability of our customers’ message recipients to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of the email components of our CRM Platform. In addition, certain states and foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada and the European Union, have enacted laws that regulate sending email, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending unsolicited email unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such email, or in other words has “opted-in” to receiving it. A requirement that recipients opt into, or the ability of recipients to opt out of, receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our platform. While these laws and regulations generally govern our customers’ use of our platform, we may be subject to certain laws as a data processor on behalf of, or as a business associate of, our customers. For example, laws and regulations governing the collection, use and disclosure of personal information include, in the United States, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and state breach notification laws, and internationally, the Data Protection Directive in the European Union and the Federal Data Protection Act in Germany. If we were found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations as a result of government enforcement or private litigation, we could be subjected to civil and criminal sanctions, including both monetary fines and injunctive action that could force us to change our business practices, all of which could adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our reputation and our business. We are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Our business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and reputational harm. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit certain transactions with U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. Although we take precautions to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets, the possibility exists that we could inadvertently provide our solutions to persons prohibited by U.S. sanctions. This could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Risks Related to Taxation 26 We may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, which could harm our business. State, local and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added, Digital Services Tax, and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of such taxes to our CRM Platform in various jurisdictions is unclear. Further, these jurisdictions’ rules regarding tax nexus are complex and vary significantly. As a result, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits, and our liability for these taxes and associated penalties could exceed our original estimates. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, value added or other taxes in those jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our application or otherwise harm our business and operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers could increase the costs of our CRM Platform and adversely impact our business. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. If we raise our prices to offset the costs of these changes, existing and potential future customers may elect not to continue or purchase our CRM Platform in the future. Additionally, new, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers’ and our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our platform. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance. We are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions. As a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. Changes in tax laws, such as tax reform in the United States or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting,” could impact our effective tax rate. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations. We may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability. We have incurred losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and we may never achieve profitability. As of December 31, 2020, we had $760 million of U.S. federal and $508 million state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which, if not utilized, some of which will begin to expire in 2027 for federal purposes and begin to expire in 2023 for state purposes. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. Our U.S federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards incurred for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 would not expire unused because they can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be further limited if we experience an “ownership change”. An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced an ownership change in the past, and future issuances of our stock could cause an ownership change. It is possible that any such ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes accrued prior to such ownership change, which could adversely affect our profitability. 27 Risks Related to Our Operating Results and Financial Condition We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future. We generated net losses of $85.0 million in 2020, $53.7 million in 2019, and $63.8 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $483.2 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to grow our marketing, sales, customer service, and content management operations, develop and enhance our CRM Platform, scale our data center infrastructure and services capabilities and expand into new markets. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease. From time to time, we may invest funds in social impact investment funds, and may receive no return on our investment or lose our entire investment. From time to time, we may invest in social impact investment funds. For example, in December 2020, we committed $20 million to social impact investing. Our first allocation of those funds was a $12.5 million investment in the Black Economic Development Fund (“BEDF”). The BEDF is managed by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (“LISC”), which expects to make investments from the BEDF in the form of bank deposits, bridge financing, and other financing to Black-led businesses, financial institutions, and anchor institutions. There is no guarantee as to the performance of this investment or any similar investments we make in the future. Depending on the performance of this investment and future investments we may make, we may not receive any return on our investment or we may lose our entire investment, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following: • changes in spending on marketing, sales and customer service software by our current or prospective customers; • pricing our CRM Platform subscriptions effectively so that we are able to attract and retain customers without compromising our profitability; • attracting new customers for our marketing, sales, customer service, and content management software, increasing our existing customers’ use of our platform and providing our customers with excellent customer support; • customer renewal rates and the amounts for which agreements are renewed; • global awareness of our thought leadership and brand; • changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers and the introduction of new products or product enhancements; • changes to the commission plans, quotas and other compensation-related metrics for our sales representatives; • the amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development, sales and marketing expenses and employee benefit expenses; • the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees while maintaining our company culture; • our ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including increases in the number of customers on our platform and the introduction and adoption of our CRM Platform in new markets outside of the United States; • unforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure, including disruptions in our hosting network infrastructure and privacy and data security; • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and • general economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets. 28 We may not be able to accurately forecast the amount and mix of future subscriptions, revenue and expenses and, as a result, our operating results may fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, or below any guidance we may provide, the price of our common stock could decline. If we do not accurately predict subscription renewal rates or otherwise fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. Because our recent growth has resulted in the rapid expansion of our business, we do not have a long history upon which to base forecasts of renewal rates with customers or future operating revenue. As a result, our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market, equity research analysts or investors, which could harm the price of our common stock. Because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the agreement, near term changes in sales may not be reflected immediately in our operating results. We offer our CRM Platform primarily through a mix of monthly, quarterly and single-year subscription agreements and generally recognize revenue ratably over the related subscription period. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from agreements entered into during prior months, quarters or years. In addition, we do not record deferred revenue beyond amounts invoiced as a liability on our balance sheet. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions or marketing solutions agreements in any one quarter is not likely to be reflected immediately in our revenue results for that quarter. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenue and deferred revenue balances in future periods, and the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenue and deferred revenue balance through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Risks Related to Our Notes Servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We incurred indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in connection with the issuance of our 0.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). In June 2020, the Company exchanged approximately $272.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes in privately-negotiated transactions for an aggregate of approximately $283.0 million in cash and 1.6 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, $125.8 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2022 Notes. In June 2020, concurrent with the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes, we incurred indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $460.0 million in connection with the issuance of our 0.375% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and together with the 2022 Notes (the “Notes”). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt. In addition, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. 29 If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. In addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could: • make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; • place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and • limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase. The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 Notes or the 2025 Notes is triggered, the holders thereof will be entitled to convert the 2022 Notes or the 2025 Notes respectively, at any time during specified periods at their option. Because the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company settled $2 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash. Between the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and February 12, 2021, the Company additionally settled $8.3 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash in response to conversion notices received prior to December 31, 2020. As of February 12, 2021, the Company has received additional conversion notices subsequent to year-end for approximately $36.1 million of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes, which will be settled in cash during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Because the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2025 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. As of February 12, 2021, no holders have converted or indicated their intention to convert the 2025 Notes. Whether the Notes that remain outstanding will be convertible following the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2020 will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or another conversion condition in the future. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. The Notes are currently classified as long-term debt, except for $7.8 million, classified as current as of December 31, 2020, for conversion notices received prior to year-end, for which the principal amount, net of discount, is expected to be cash-settled within the next fiscal quarter. The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion option of the Notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheet and as a discount to the Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the Notes, net of the discount recorded, will be accreted up to the principal amount of the Notes from the issuance date until maturity, which will result in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we will report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s accretion of the debt discount and the instrument’s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. 30 In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. In August 2020, the FASB issued guidance simplifying ASC 470-20 by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Under the new guidance, we will no longer be required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. This will have the impact of reducing non-cash interest expense, and thereby increasing net income (or decreasing net losses). Additionally, the new guidance eliminates the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires use of the “if-converted” method, which would decrease (increase) our diluted net income (loss) per share. The new standard is effective beginning in January 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you purchased them. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies, including providers of software via the cloud-based model, have been highly volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in October 2014 at a price of $25.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $25.79 to $420.61, through December 31, 2020. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results, including as a result of the addition or loss of any number of customers; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; • the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; • failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in ratings and financial estimates and the publication of other news by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; • changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of cloud-based software or other technology companies, or those in our industry in particular; • price and volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock and in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; • sales of large blocks of our common stock or the dilutive effect of our Notes or any other equity or equity-linked financings; • new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or industry, including data privacy and data security; • lawsuits threatened or filed against us; • changes in key personnel; and • other events or factors, including changes in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business. 31 If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. As a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. We expect that compliance with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Furthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these requirements effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that: • authorize “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; • provide for a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms; • specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer or the president; • prohibit stockholder action by written consent; • establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; • provide that our directors may be removed only for cause; • provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; • specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; • authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and • require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. 32 In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us in certain circumstances. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. General Risks Failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business. Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. As we have expanded our international operations our exposure exchange rate fluctuations has increased, in particular with respect to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Australian Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen and Colombian Peso. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results, when re-measured, may differ materially from expectations. In addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuation if our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions and expenses changes in the future. Furthermore, global political events, including Brexit and similar geopolitical developments, fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments, have caused global economic uncertainty, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to predict our future results and earnings accurately. Although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. Additionally, as we anticipate growing our business further outside of the United States, the effects of movements in currency exchange rates will increase as our transaction volume outside of the United States increases. Weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. Global financial developments and downturns seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us. The United States and other key international economies have been affected from time to time by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy, including with respect to tariff and trade issues. In particular, the economies of countries in Europe have been experiencing weakness associated with high sovereign debt levels, weakness in the banking sector, uncertainty over the future of the Euro zone and volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the Euro, including instability surrounding Brexit. We have operations, as well as current and potential new customers, throughout most of Europe. If economic conditions in Europe and other key markets for our platform continue to remain uncertain or deteriorate further, it could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to subscribe to our platform, delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates, all of which could harm our operating results. Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing. Our business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds to invest in future growth opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. The Notes are and any additional equity or equity-linked financings would be dilutive to our stockholders. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond 33 our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. Properties We occupy approximately 443,000 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts pursuant to lease agreements that expire through 2029. We also maintain offices in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Dublin, Ireland, Sydney, Australia, Singapore, Tokyo, Japan, Berlin, Germany, Bogotá, Colombia, Paris, France, and Ghent, Belgium. We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs. We intend to add new facilities or expand existing facilities as we add employees, and we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any such expansion of our operations. ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the ultimate costs to resolve any pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not Applicable. 34 PART II ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information for Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HUBS” since October 9, 2014. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our common stock. Our initial public offering was priced at $25.00 per share on October 8, 2014. As of February 12, 2021, we had 27 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of shareholders is greater than this number of record holders, and includes shareholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include shareholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities. Dividends We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings to fund development and growth of our business, and do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be, subject to applicable law, at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and capital requirements.

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans See Item 12, “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters,” for information regarding securities authorized for issuance. Outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, Convertible Note Hedge, and Warrant In May 2017, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the “2022 Notes”) due June 1, 2022, of which $272.1 million was repurchased in June 2020 and $2 million was settled in cash during the fourth quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $125.8 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2022 Notes. Also in June 2020, we issued $460 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due June 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, the Company purchased capped call options (“Capped Call Options”) that give the Company the option to purchase up to approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $282.52 per share. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Convertible Note Hedges”) with certain counterparties in which the Company has the option to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of approximately $94.77 per share. In addition, the Company sold warrants (the “Warrants”) to certain bank counterparties whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $115.8 per share. As of December 31, 2020, Convertible Note Hedges corresponding to approximately 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock and Warrants corresponding to approximately 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock remain outstanding. See Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 36 ITEM 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Company Overview We provide a cloud-based customer relationship management (“CRM”) Platform. Our CRM Platform is comprised of Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub and content management system (“CMS”) Hub as well as other tools and integrations that enable companies to attract, engage, and delight customers throughout the customer experience. At the core of our CRM Platform is our CRM that our customers use which creates a single view of all interactions a prospective or existing customer has with their marketing, sales and customer service teams. The CRM shares data across every application in the CRM Platform, automatically informing more personalized emails, website content, ads, and conversations, and enables more accurate timing cues for our customer’s internal teams. In addition, the CRM Platform was built to easily and seamlessly integrate third party applications to further customize to an individual company’s industry or needs. We designed and built our CRM Platform to serve a broad range of customers globally. Our CRM Platform starts completely free and grows with our customers to meet their needs at different stages in their life-cycles. It supports multiple languages and currencies and offers an array of sophisticated features, including content partitioning at the enterprise level for companies operating in or serving multiple countries. We focus on selling to mid-market business-to-business, or B2B, companies, which we define as companies that have between two and 2,000 employees. While our CRM Platform was built to grow with any company, we focus on selling to mid-market businesses because we believe we have significant competitive advantages attracting and serving this market segment. These mid-market businesses seek an integrated, easy-to-implement and easy-to-use solution to reach customers and compete with organizations that have larger marketing, sales, and customer service budgets. We efficiently reach these businesses at scale through our proven inbound methodology, our Solutions Partners, and our “freemium” model. A Solutions Partner is a service provider that helps businesses with strategy, execution, and implementation of go-to-market activities and technology solutions. Our freemium model attracts customers who begin using our CRM Platform through our free products and then upgrade to our paid products. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,225 full-time employees and 103,994 Total Customers of varying sizes in more than 120 countries, representing almost every industry. Our CRM Platform is a multi-tenant, single code-based and globally available software-as-a-service product delivered through web browsers or mobile applications. We sell our CRM Platform on a subscription basis. Our total revenue increased to $883.0 million in 2020, from $674.9 million in 2019, and from $513.0 million in 2018, representing year-over-year increases of 31% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. We had net losses of $85.0 million in 2020, $53.7 million in 2019, and $63.8 million in 2018, primarily due to investments in our growth. We derive most of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based CRM Platform and related professional services, which consist of customer on-boarding and training services. Subscription revenue accounted for 97% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 96% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 95% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We sell multiple product plans at different base prices on a subscription basis, each of which includes our CRM and integrated applications to meet the needs of the various customers we serve. Customers pay additional fees if the number of contacts stored and tracked in the customer’s database exceeds specified thresholds. We also generate additional revenue based on the purchase of additional subscriptions and products, and the number of account users and subdomains. Most of our customers’ subscriptions are one year or less in duration. Subscriptions are billed in advance on various schedules. Because the mix of billing terms for orders can vary from period to period, the annualized value of the orders we enter into with our customers will not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that change in deferred revenue is an accurate indicator of future revenue. Many of our customers purchase on-boarding and training services which are designed to help customers enhance their ability to attract, engage and delight their customers using our CRM Platform. Professional services and other revenue accounted for 3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect professional services and other margins to range from a moderate loss to breakeven for the foreseeable future. 39 COVID-19 Update In March 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a pandemic (the “pandemic”). This pandemic is having widespread, rapidly-evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential businesses, quarantines, work-from-home directives, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on public gatherings. These measurements have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers, and ensuring business continuity. In March 2020, we temporarily closed our global offices, including our corporate headquarters, suspended all company-related travel, and all HubSpot employees globally were required to work from home. We shifted our Solutions Partner events and INBOUND 2020 to virtual-only experiences and have cancelled other customer and industry events. During the third quarter of 2020, we began to slowly re-open our offices on a staggered, region-to-region basis in accordance with local authority guidelines while ensuring that our return to work was thoughtful, prudent, and handled with an abundance of caution with the health of our employees being the top priority. During the fourth quarter of 2020, due to surges in COVID-19 cases at almost all of our office locations, we elected to close all of our global offices. We are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic and will continue to be thoughtful about employee safety and well-being. Given that the economic consequences of the pandemic have been exceptionally challenging for many of our customers and prospects, we also implemented certain changes to our pricing structure in March 2020, including reducing prices on our Starter Growth Suite, offering certain product functionality free of charge for a limited time, suspending marketing email send limits for a limited time, and offering a one-time six-month advance on commissions to certain of our Solutions Partners. While the pandemic has not had a material adverse financial impact on our business to date, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance will depend on future developments and conditions. The pandemic and its adverse effects are prevalent in the locations where we, our customers, and partners conduct business. As a result, at the outset of the pandemic, we experienced, and may again experience in the future, curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. Specifically, we may be impacted by changes in our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our offerings; changes in the timing of our current or prospective customers’ purchasing decisions; pricing discounts or extended payment terms; reductions in the amount or duration of customers’ subscription contracts; or increased customer attrition rates. While our revenue, customer retention, and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the effect of the pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. While the implications of the pandemic remain uncertain, we plan to continue to make investments to support business growth. We believe that the growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to expand our customer base, increase adoption of our CRM Platform within existing customers, develop new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform and provide a high level of customer service. We expect to invest in sales and marketing to support customer growth. We also expect to invest in research and development as we continue to introduce new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform. We also intend to maintain a high level of customer service and support which we consider critical for our continued success. We plan to continue to invest in our data center infrastructure and services capabilities in order to support continued customer growth. We also expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses to support our business and to maintain the infrastructure required to be a public company. We expect to use our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our convertible debt and stock offerings to fund these growth strategies and support our business despite the potential impact from the pandemic and do not expect to be profitable in the near term. 40 Key Business Metrics The following key business metrics are presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our press releases announcing our financial results which are furnished on Form 8-K. We use these key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and results of operations, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. These key business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar key business metrics used by other companies. Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Total Customers 103,994 73,483 56,628 Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer $ 9,582 $ 9,920 9,904 Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate 102.3 % 99.9 % 100.7 % Total Customers. We believe that our ability to increase our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and growth of our business as we continue to expand our sales force and invest in marketing efforts. We define our Total Customers at the end of a particular period as the number of business entities or individuals with one or more paid subscriptions to our CRM Platform either paid directly or through a Solutions Partner. We do not include in Total Customers business entities or individuals with one or more paid subscriptions solely for our legacy Sales Hub ($10) product or any PieSync product. A single customer may have separate paid subscriptions for separate websites, sales licenses or seats, or our Sales Hub, Marketing Hub, Service Hub, or CMS Hub products, but we count these as one customer if certain customer-provided information such as company name, URL, or email address indicate that these subscriptions are managed by the same business entity or individual. Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer. We believe that our ability to increase the Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer is an indicator of our ability to grow the long-term value of our existing customer relationships. We define Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer during a particular period as subscription revenue, excluding revenue from our legacy Sales Hub ($10) and PieSync products, from our Total Customers during the period divided by the average Total Customers during the same period. Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate. We believe that our ability to retain and expand a customer relationship is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customers. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate. We compare the aggregate Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue of our Total Customer base as of the beginning of each month, which we refer to as Total Retention Base Revenue, to the aggregate Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue of the same group of Total Customers at the end of that month, which we refer to as Total Retained Subscription Revenue. We define Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue as the total amount of subscription fees contractually committed to be paid for a full month under all of our Total Customer agreements, excluding any commissions owed to our Solutions Partners. Our Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate for a given period is calculated by first dividing Total Retained Subscription Revenue by Total Retention Base Revenue for each month in the period, calculating the weighted average of these rates using the Total Retention Base Revenue for each month in the period, and then annualizing the resulting rates. Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations Revenue We derive our revenue from two major sources, revenue from subscriptions to our CRM Platform and professional services and other revenue consisting mainly of on-boarding and training services fees. Subscription based revenue is derived from customers using our CRM Platform for their inbound marketing, sales, service, and content management needs. Our CRM Platform features integrated applications that create a cohesive and adaptable customer experience. These integrated applications include a CRM, search engine optimization, blogging, website content management, messaging, chatbots, social media, marketing automation, email, predictive lead scoring, sales productivity, ticketing and helpdesk tools, customer NPS surveys, analytics, and reporting. Subscriptions are billed in advance on various schedules. All subscription fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Subscription based revenue is recognized net of consideration paid to Solutions Partners when those Partners purchase a subscription to our CRM Platform. Professional services and other revenue are derived primarily from customer on-boarding and training services. The on-boarding and training services provided to customers typically involves an implementation specialist. An implementation specialist will typically work with our customers to enhance their understanding of how to attract leads and convert them into customers through search engine optimization, social media, blogging and other content. Training is generally sold in connection with a customer’s initial 41 subscription and is billed in advance. The training is also available to be purchased separately following a customer’s purchase of its initial subscription and our Solutions Partners routinely provide the same training to customers. The Company recognizes revenue from on-boarding and training services as the services are provided. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, employee-related costs including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our customer support team, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs, which we define as rent, facilities, depreciation of fixed assets, and costs related to information technology. Cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel costs of our professional services organization, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platform, as well as allocated overhead costs. We expect that cost of subscription and professional services and other revenue will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing our business. Over time, we expect to gain benefits of scale associated with our costs of hosting our CRM Platform relative to subscription revenues, resulting in improved subscription gross margin, exclusive of stock-based compensation. We expect professional services and other margins to range from a moderate loss to breakeven for the foreseeable future, exclusive of stock-based compensation. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new products and adding incremental functionality to our CRM Platform and amortize such costs as costs of subscription revenue over the estimated life of the new product or incremental functionality, which is generally two years. We also capitalize certain development costs that are attributable to developing our internally developed software platforms and amortize such costs throughout the consolidated statement of operations over the estimated life of our internally developed software platforms, which is generally five years. We focus our research and development efforts on improving our products and developing new ones, delivering new functionality and enhancing the customer experience. We believe delivering new functionality for our customers is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to a broad array of options and information critical to their marketing, sales, and customer service efforts. We expect to continue to make investments in and expand our offerings to enhance our customers’ experience and satisfaction and attract new customers. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase the functionality of our CRM Platform. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual INBOUND conference, other brand building expenses, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platforms, and allocated overhead costs. We defer certain sales commissions related to acquiring new contracts and amortize them ratably over a period of benefit that we have determined to be approximately one to three years. Sales and marketing expenses also include commissions paid to our Solutions Partners in instances where the end customer purchases and pays for a subscription to our CRM Platform. We plan to continue to expand sales and marketing to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. This growth will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to generate additional leads and build brand awareness. We expect sales and marketing expenses will increase as a result of hiring net new quota-carrying sales representatives in the United States and worldwide and adding to our marketing staff. Over time, we expect sales and marketing expenses will decline as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, employee-related information technology, administrative personnel, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platforms, and allocated overhead costs. We expect that 42 general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis but decrease as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation expense, as we focus on processes, systems and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business. We also anticipate continuing increases to general and administrative expenses as we incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including audit and consulting fees. Other Expense Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash and cash equivalents balances and investments. Interest expense primarily consists of amortization of the debt discount, issuance costs and contractual interest expense related to our Notes, and the loss on early extinguishment of our 2022 Notes. Other expense primarily consists of the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities. Income Tax Expense The income tax expense consists of current and deferred taxes for U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We have historically had a taxable loss in our most significant jurisdiction, the U.S., and a full valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets. We expect this to continue in the near term. Results of Operations The following tables set forth certain consolidated financial data in dollar amounts and as a percentage of total revenue.

Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Revenue Year Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount % (dollars in thousands) Subscription $ 853,025 $ 646,266 $ 206,759 32 % Professional services and other 30,001 28,594 1,407 5 % Total revenue $ 883,026 $ 674,860 $ 208,166 31 % Subscription revenue increased during 2020 due to an increase throughout the year in Total Customers, which grew from 73,483 as of December 31, 2019 to 103,994 as of December 31, 2020. Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer decreased from $9,920 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $9,582 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth in Total Customers was primarily driven by our increased sales representative capacity to meet market demand as well as our freemium product offering and lower priced starer products. The decrease in average subscription revenue per customer was driven primarily by the volume of continued purchases of our lower priced starter products. The 5% increase in professional services and other revenue resulted primarily from the increase in Total Customers and from the delivery of on-boarding services for the additional subscriptions sold, slightly offset by fewer classroom trainings being held due to social gathering restrictions and travel bans implemented due to the pandemic. Year Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount % (dollars in thousands) Total cost of revenue $ 166,959 $ 129,958 $ 37,001 28 % Gross profit 716,067 544,902 171,165 31 % Gross margin 81 % 81 % 44 Total cost of revenue increased 28% during 2020 primarily due to an increase in subscription and hosting costs, employee-related costs, amortization of capitalized software development costs, and allocated overheard expenses, offset by a decrease in amortization of acquired technology due to certain acquired technology reaching the end of its useful life during the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross margin remained consistent year-over-year. Year Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount % (dollars in thousands) Subscription cost of revenue $ 130,685 $ 98,510 $ 32,175 33 % Percentage of subscription revenue 15 % 15 % The increase in subscription cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the following: Change (in thousands) Subscription and hosting costs $ 21,990 Employee-related costs 5,238 Amortization of capitalized software development costs 4,834 Allocated overhead expenses 974 Amortization of acquired technology (861 ) $ 32,175 Subscription and hosting costs increased primarily due to growth in our Total Customer base from 73,483 at December 31, 2019 to 103,994 at December 31, 2020. Additionally, we saw higher subscription and hosting costs as we focus on the security, reliability and performance of our CRM Platform. Employee-related costs increased as a result of increased headcount as we continue to grow our customer support organization to support our customer growth and improve service levels and offerings, offset slightly by reduced discretionary spending as a result of the pandemic. Amortization of capitalized software development costs increased due to the increased number of developers working on our software platform as we continue to develop new products and increased functionality. Allocated overhead expenses increased due to the expansion of our leased space and infrastructure as we continued to grow our business and expand headcount.

Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer increased from $9,904 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9,920 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The growth in Total Customers was primarily driven by our increased sales representative capacity to meet market demand as well as the freemium model. The increase in 47 average subscription revenue per customer was driven primarily by existing customers increasing their use of our products, existing customers purchasing additional subscriptions, and new customers purchasing our higher price product plans. The increase in average subscription revenue per customer was partially offset by the continued adoption of our freemium model. The 12% increase in professional services and other revenue resulted primarily from the increase in Total Customers and from delivery of on-boarding and training services for the additional subscriptions sold.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity to date have been cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, our common stock offerings, and our convertible notes offerings. The following table shows cash and cash equivalents, working capital, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities, net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities, and net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 378,123 $ 269,670 $ 111,489 Working capital 1,011,420 787,235 475,409 Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities 88,913 118,973 84,851 Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities (215,567 ) (316,194 ) (71,230 ) Net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities 222,460 359,342 12,778 Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 was held for working capital purposes. We believe our working capital is sufficient to support our operations for at least the next 12 months. At December 31, 2020, $83.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in accounts outside the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we no longer assert indefinite reinvestment of our foreign earnings because these earnings have been subject to U.S. Federal tax. While we have concluded that any incremental tax incurred upon ultimate distribution of these earnings to be immaterial, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations. Net Cash and Cash Equivalents Provided by Operating Activities Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities consists primarily of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges, net.

These sources of cash and cash equivalents were offset by a $17.7 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business, and a $23.9 million increase in deferred commissions. Net Cash and Cash Equivalents Used in Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases, maturities and sale of investments, property and equipment purchases, an acquisition of a business, strategic investments, and capitalization of software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are related to new products or improvements to our existing software platform that expands the functionality for our customers.

In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during and as of the reporting periods. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which typically include subscriptions to our online software solutions and professional services which include on-boarding and training services. Our customers do not have the right to take possession of the online software products. Revenue from online software products is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the online software product is made available to customers. We recognize revenue from on-boarding and training services as the services are provided. Amounts billed that have not yet met the applicable revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each good or service. We calculate SSP for each type of online software product and professional service offering by averaging the selling price of all purchases within the trailing four calendar quarters. We use four quarters of transaction data to determine SSP as most of our customer arrangements are one year or less and pricing may be subject to change upon each customer’s renewal. In instances where there are not sufficient data points, or the average selling prices for a particular online software product or professional service offering are disparate, we estimate the SSP using other observable inputs, such as similar products or services. If the actual selling price for the sale of an online software product or professional service offering within a multiple performance obligation arrangement substantially differs from the SSP of that offering, we use the relative SSP to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer Sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental, recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be approximately one to three years. The one to three-year period has been determined by taking into consideration the type of product sold, the commitment term of the customer contract, the nature of the Company’s technology development life-cycle, and an estimated customer relationship period. Sales commissions for upgrade contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated customer relationship period of the related customer. Capitalized Software Development Costs Software development costs consist of certain payroll and stock compensation costs incurred to develop functionality for our CRM Platform and internally-built software platforms, as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are expected to result in enhanced functionality. We capitalize certain software development costs for new offerings as well as upgrades to our existing software platforms, while costs associated with planning new developments and maintaining our CRM Platform software and internally built software platforms are expensed as incurred.. We amortize these development costs over the estimated useful life of two to five years on a straight-line basis. We determined that a two- to five- year life is appropriate for our internal-use software based on our best estimate of the useful life of the internally developed software after considering factors such as continuous developments in the technology, obsolescence, and anticipated life of the service offering before significant upgrades. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a quarterly basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We determine the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by our developers on projects in the application stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating the time allocated to a particular project in the application stage. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods. 53 Leases On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease guidance using a modified retrospective transition method applied to those leases which were not completed as of January 1, 2019. We lease office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through May 2031. Certain leases contain optional termination dates. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and does not separate lease and non-lease components of an arrangement determined to contain a lease. Operating and finance leases with a duration of less than 12 months are excluded from right-of-use-assets and lease liabilities and related expense is recorded as incurred. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of operating lease payments. To determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, we use publicly available credit ratings for peer companies. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments, which requires judgment. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Contractual obligations are cash that we are obligated to pay as part of certain contracts that we have entered during our course of business. Certain of our leases contain optional termination dates. The table below only includes payments up to the optional termination date. If we were to extend leases beyond the optional termination date, the future commitments would increase by approximately $90.8 million. Below is a table that shows the projected outlays as of December 31, 2020: Payments due in: Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Operating leases obligations 388,962 51,933 100,443 97,303 139,283 Vendor commitments 102,397 31,138 71,259 — — Total $ 491,359 $ 83,071 $ 171,702 $ 97,303 $ 139,283 Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $3.4 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above, are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until 2029. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2020 or 2019 exclusive of items described above and indemnifications of officers, directors and employees for certain events or occurrences while the officer, director or employee is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information on recent accounting pronouncements, see Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 54 ITEM 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Australian dollar, Singaporean dollar, Japanese Yen, and Colombian Peso. Since we translate foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We recognized immaterial amounts of foreign currency gains and losses in each of the periods presented. We have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as we expand our international operation, and our risk grows. Interest Rate Sensitivity Our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments is maintained in a variety of securities, including government agency obligations, corporate bonds and money market funds. Investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and carried at their fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. A sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio. We do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Inflation Risk We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business. However, if our costs, in particular personnel, sales and marketing and hosting costs, were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In May 2017, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior due June 1, 2022, of which $272.1 million was repurchased in June 2020 and $2 million was settled in cash in the fourth quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $125.8 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2022 Notes. Also in June 2020, we issued $460 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due June 1, 2025. The fair value of our convertible senior notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines in value. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our convertible senior notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Generally, the fair values of 2022 Notes and the 2025 Notes (the “Notes”) will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Additionally, we carry the convertible senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10% changes of our stock price as of December 31, 2020 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the Notes. The selected scenarios are not predictions of future events, but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such event may have on the fair value of the Notes. 2022 Notes Hypothetical change in HubSpot stock price Fair value Estimated change in fair value Hypothetical percentage increase (decrease) in fair value 10% increase $ 577,631 $ 50,480 10 % No change $ 527,151 $ — — 10% decrease $ 472,359 $ (54,792 ) (10 )% 55 2025 Notes Hypothetical change in HubSpot stock price Fair value Estimated change in fair value Hypothetical percentage increase (decrease) in fair value 10% increase $ 794,047 $ 75,240 10 % No change $ 718,807 $ — — 10% decrease $ 679,664 $ (39,143 ) (5 )% 56 ITEM 8.

Consolidated Balance Sheets 60 Consolidated Statements of Operations 61 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss 62 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity 63 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 64 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 66 57 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of HubSpot, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HubSpot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 58 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Capitalized software development costs – estimate of time and related costs eligible for capitalization As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated capitalized software development costs, net balance was $24.9 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company capitalizes certain software development costs for new offerings as well as upgrades to existing software platforms. Management determines the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by developers on projects in the application stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating time allocated to a particular project in the application stage. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the estimate of time and related costs eligible for capitalization as capitalized software development costs is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the amount of time to capitalize for projects; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determination of capitalized costs and management’s judgment related to the amount of time incurred by developers on projects in the application stage. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to capitalized software development costs, including controls over management’s estimate of time and related costs eligible for capitalization. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the time and related costs eligible for capitalization in the current year, (ii) evaluating whether the time and related costs were eligible for capitalization, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in management’s estimate of eligible time and related costs, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management in estimating eligible time and related costs. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to eligible software development time for capitalization involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) inquiries with management and IT product development managers in evaluating the software development costs capitalized for a sample of capitalized projects, and (ii) evaluating management’s estimate of hours through inquiry with a sample of individual software developers regarding the nature, timing and extent of time worked on development activities. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 16, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016. 59 HUBSPOT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization and Operations HubSpot, Inc. (the “Company”) provides a cloud-based CRM Platform, that enables companies to attract, engage, and delight customers throughout the customer experience. The Company’s CRM Platform, comprised of Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, and a CMS Hub features integrated applications and tools that enable businesses to create a cohesive and adaptable customer experience. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a global pandemic (the “pandemic”). The Company has assessed the impact of the pandemic, and while the broader implications of the pandemic on the results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain, the Company assessed the potential impact on the December 31, 2020 financial statements and determined there were no material adjustments necessary with respect to these consolidated financial statements. Given that the economic consequences of the pandemic have been exceptionally challenging for many customers, in March 2020, the Company implemented certain changes to pricing and packaging, including reducing prices on certain products and offering certain product functionality free of charge for a limited time. The Company also made a one-time payment to certain Solutions Partners for six months of commissions in advance of them being earned. While revenue, customer retention, and earnings are relatively predictable under a subscription-based business model, the potential effect of the pandemic will not be fully reflected in the results of operations and overall financial performance of the Company until future periods given the current macro-economic uncertainty. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law by the United States. The CARES Act provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended to address the impact of the pandemic, including tax relief and government loans, grants, and investments. In June 2020, the Jobs Support Scheme (“JSS”) was announced by the Singapore government to provide support to employers and help enterprises retain their local employees during the pandemic. The CARES Act and the JSS did not have a material impact with respect to these consolidated financial statements. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation —The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates —The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating Segments —The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is the Company’s chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Loss Per Share — Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase common stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), shares issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), the Warrants (defined below), the Conversion Option of the 2022 Notes, and the Conversion Option of the 2025 Notes (the “Conversion Options”) (Note 9) are considered to be potential common stock equivalents. 66 A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net loss $ (85,031 ) $ (53,746 ) $ (63,828 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding—basic 44,757 42,025 38,529 Dilutive effect of share equivalents resulting from stock options, RSUs, ESPP, Warrants and the Conversion Options — — — Weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted 44,757 42,025 38,529 Net loss per common share, basic and diluted $ (1.90 ) $ (1.28 ) $ (1.66 ) Since the Company incurred net losses for each of the periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share. All of the Company’s outstanding stock options, RSUs, and shares issuable under the ESPP, as well as the Warrants and Conversion Options were excluded in the calculation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. The Company expects to settle the principal amount of the Notes (Note 9) in cash, and therefore, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Warrants and Conversion Options on diluted net income per share, if applicable. As a result, only the amount by which the conversion cost of the Notes, if settled in shares, exceeds the aggregated principal amount of the Notes (the “Conversion Spread”) is considered in the diluted earnings per share computation. The Conversion Spread has a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period of time exceeds the initial conversion price of $94.77 per share for the 2022 Notes and $282.52 for the 2025 Notes. The average stock price for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $240.59. As the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price of $94.77 on each applicable trading day, the 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company settled approximately $2 million of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash. Between the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and February 12, 2021, the Company additionally settled $8.3 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash in response to conversion notices received prior to December 31, 2020. As of February 12, 2021, the Company has received additional conversion notices subsequent to year-end for approximately $36.1 million of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes, which will be settled in cash during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. For disclosure purposes, the potentially dilutive effect of the Conversion Spread is calculated and included in the table below. As the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price of $282.52 on each applicable trading day, the 2025 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2021. As of February 12, 2021, no holders have converted or indicated their intention to convert the 2025 Notes. For disclosure purposes, the potentially dilutive effect of the Conversion Spread is calculated and included in the table below. The following table contains all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Options to purchase common shares 1,020 1,489 1,824 RSUs 1,561 1,207 1,732 Conversion Option of the 2022 Notes and Warrants 1,873 3,104 1,211 Conversion Option of the 2025 Notes 318 — — ESPP 21 2 — Cash and Cash Equivalents — 67 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in bank deposit accounts and short-term, highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, consisting primarily of money-market funds. Investments — Investments consist of commercial paper, corporate debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Securities having remaining maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase and less than one year from the date of the balance sheets are classified as short-term, and those with maturities of more than one year from the date of the balance sheet are classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company classifies its debt investments with readily determinable market values as available-for-sale. These investments are classified as investments on the consolidated balance sheets and are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in nature reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Company reviews all investments for reductions in fair value that are other-than-temporary. When such reductions occur, the cost of the investment is adjusted to fair value through recording a loss on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on investments are calculated on the basis of specific identification. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company periodically evaluates whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors: the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors; overall market conditions and trends and the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. Strategic investments — Strategic investments consist of non-controlling equity investments in privately held companies. These investments without readily determinable fair values for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the non-marketable securities are carried at cost less any impairments, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts — Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the probability of future collection. The probability of future collection is based on specific considerations of historical loss patterns and an assessment of the continuation of such patterns based on past collection trends and known or anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The probability of future collection is also assessed by geography. To date, losses resulting from uncollected receivables have not exceeded management’s expectations. The following is a roll forward of the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands): Balance Beginning of Period Charged to Statement of Operations Deductions (1) Balance at End of Period Allowance for doubtful accounts Year ended December 31, 2020 $ 1,584 $ 8,501 $ (8,092 ) $ 1,993 Year ended December 31, 2019 $ 1,317 $ 7,895 $ (7,628 ) $ 1,584 Year ended December 31, 2018 $ 638 $ 5,514 $ (4,835 ) $ 1,317 (1) Deductions include actual accounts written-off, net of recoveries. Restricted Cash —The Company had restricted cash of $3.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $8.8 million at December 31, 2019 related to letters of credit for it leased facilities. The following table provides a reconciliation of the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 378,123 $ 269,670 Restricted cash, included in other assets 3,029 8,845 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 381,152 $ 278,515 68 Property and Equipment —Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, whereas major betterments are capitalized as additions to leasehold improvements. Depreciation is recorded over the following estimated useful lives: Estimated Useful Life Employee related computer equipment 2 - 3 years Computer equipment and purchased software 3 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Internal-use software 5 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or useful life The Company capitalizes certain payroll and stock compensation costs incurred to develop functionality for certain of the Company’s internally built software platforms. The costs incurred during the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once a piece of incremental functionality has reached the development stage certain internal costs are capitalized until the functionality is ready for its intended use. Internal-use software is included within property and equipment on the balance sheet. The costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of approximately five years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets —Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. Management considers the following potential indicators of impairment of its long-lived assets (asset group): a substantial decrease in the Company’s stock price, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the long-lived asset (asset group), an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset (asset group), and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there may be an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. For the years presented, the Company did not recognize an impairment charge. Intangible Assets — Intangible assets consist of acquired technology, trade name and customer relationships. The Company records acquired intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortize such assets in a pattern reflective of the expected economic benefits consumption over the expected useful life of the asset. If this pattern cannot be reliably determined, a straight-line amortization method is used. The estimated useful life of acquired technology is two to seven years and is based on the period over which economic benefits will be derived from each acquired intangible asset. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Goodwill —Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is monitored annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. Management considers the following potential indicators of impairment: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the Company’s use of acquired assets or the strategy of the Company’s overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends and a significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period. The Company performs its annual impairment test on November 30. Currently, the Company’s goodwill is evaluated at the entity level as it has been determined there is one operating segment comprised of one reporting unit. When assessing goodwill for impairment the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. If the Company determines it is unlikely that the reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying value then no quantitative assessment is performed. If the Company cannot determine that it is likely that the reporting unit fair value is more than its carrying value, then the Company performs a quantitative assessment. Based on the qualitative assessment performed on November 30, 2020, the Company determined it was unlikely that it’s reporting unit fair value was less than its carrying value and no quantitative assessment was required. There were no indicators that the Company’s goodwill had become impaired since that date, and as such, there was no impairment of goodwill as of November 30, 2020 or December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not recognize an impairment charge. Business Combinations — The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as acquired assets and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations are based on, among other factors, estimates 69 of future expected cash flows attributable to the acquired intangible assets and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Advertising Expense —The Company expenses advertising as incurred, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred $21.9 million of advertising expense in 2020, $14.9 million in 2019, and $8.4 million in 2018. Leases — On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease guidance using a modified retrospective transition method applied to those leases which were not completed as of January 1, 2019. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and does not separate lease and non-lease components of an arrangement determined to contain a lease. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Operating and finance leases with a duration of less than 12 months are excluded from right-of-use-assets and operating lease liabilities and related expense is recorded as incurred. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The lease ROU asset includes any initial direct costs incurred and is reduced for tenant incentives. As the Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. To determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, the Company uses publicly available credit ratings for peer companies. The Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance leases use the effective interest method to record expense which results in a front-loaded expense recognition pattern. Asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) On the lease commencement date the Company establishes an ARO based on the present value of contractually required estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. The asset associated with the ARO is amortized over the corresponding lease term to operating expense and the ARO is accreted to the end of lease obligation value over the same term. Revenue Recognition — The Company generates revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which typically include subscriptions to its online software products and professional services which include on-boarding and training services. The Company’s customers do not have the right to take possession of the online software products. The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below: • Identify the customer contract; • Identify performance obligations that are distinct; • Determine the transaction price; • Allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and • Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. 70 Identify the customer contract A customer contract is generally identified when the Company and a customer have executed an arrangement that calls for the Company to grant access to its online software products and provide professional services in exchange for consideration from the customer. Identify performance obligations that are distinct A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and a company’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company has determined that subscriptions for its online software products are distinct because, once a customer has access to the online software product that it purchased, the online software product is fully functional and does not require any additional development, modification, or customization. Professional services sold are distinct because the customer benefits from the on-boarding and training to make better use of the online software products it purchased. Determine the transaction price The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies. The Company estimates any variable consideration to which it will be entitled at contract inception, and reassesses at each reporting date, when determining the transaction price. The Company does not include variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will occur when any uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. The Company determines the SSP of its goods and services based upon the average sales prices for each type of online software product and professional services sold. In instances where there are not sufficient data points, or the selling prices for a particular online software product or professional service are disparate, the Company estimates the SSP using other observable inputs, such as similar products or services. Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied Revenues are recognized when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers. Revenue from online software products is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the Company’s online software products are made available to customers. Most subscription contracts are one year or less. The Company recognizes revenue from on-boarding and training services as the services are provided. Cash payments received in advance of providing subscription or services are recorded to deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. Solutions Partner Commissions The Company pays its Solutions Partners a commission based on the online software product sales price for sales to end-customers. The classification of the commission paid in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations depends on who purchases the online software product. In instances where an end-customer purchases from the Company, the commission paid to the Solutions Partner is recorded as sales and marketing expense. When a Solutions Partner purchases from the Company, the commission paid to the Solutions Partner is netted against the associated revenue recognized. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers —Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, investments and accounts receivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large financial institutions. Although the Company's deposits may exceed federally insured limits, the financial institutions that the Company uses have high investment-grade credit ratings and, as a result, the Company believes that, as of December 31, 2020, its risk relating to deposits exceeding federally insured limits was not significant. The Company’s investments consist of highly rated corporate debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company limits the amount of investments in any single issuer, except U.S. Treasuries. The Company believes that, as of December 31, 2020, its concentration of credit risk related to investments was not significant. 71 The Company has no significant off-balance sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other hedging arrangements. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers and generally requires payment 30 days from the invoice date. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. Credit risk arising from accounts receivable is mitigated as a result of transacting with a large number of geographically dispersed customers spread across various industries. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no customers that represented more than 10% of the net accounts receivable balance. There were no customers that individually exceeded 10% of the Company’s revenue in any of the periods presented. Foreign Currency —The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, with the resulting translation adjustments directly recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Income and expense accounts are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other expense. Research and Development —Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits and other expenses associated with product development. Also included is a benefit related to an Irish research and development tax credit, under which the Company is able to obtain a refundable credit of up to 25% of eligible research and development expenses incurred. The credit is recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses in the period in which the eligible expenses are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Capitalized Software Development Costs —Certain payroll and stock compensation costs incurred to develop functionality for the Company’s software and internally built software platforms, as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are expected to result in enhanced functionality are capitalized. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, the Company capitalizes certain software development costs for new offerings as well as upgrades to existing software platforms. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of two to five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a quarterly basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. The Company determines the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by the developers on projects in the application stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating time allocated to a particular project in the application stage. Costs associated with building or significantly enhancing the CRM Platform and internally built software platforms are capitalized, while costs associated with planning new developments and maintaining the CRM Platform software and internally built software platforms are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs, exclusive of those costs recorded within property and equipment, consisted of the following: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Gross capitalized software development costs $ 85,630 $ 61,641 Accumulated amortization (60,687 ) (44,848 ) Capitalized software development costs, net $ 24,943 $ 16,793 Amortization of capitalized software development costs, exclusive of costs recorded within property and equipment, was $16.0 million in 2020, $11.6 million in 2019, and $9.2 million in 2018. Amortization expense is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes —Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements is in accordance with accounting authoritative guidance, which prescribes a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 72 Stock-Based Compensation — The Company accounts for all stock options and awards granted to employees and nonemployees using a fair value method. Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense and is measured at the fair value of the award. The measurement date for awards is generally the date of the grant. For stock options, the Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to measure the fair value of the grant. The fair value of the Company’s common stock is the closing price of the stock on the date of the grant. The expected term of options granted to employees was calculated using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted-average vesting period of the option. The Company considers this appropriate as there is no other method that would be more indicative of exercise activity. The expected volatility for the Company’s common stock was based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of similar public companies. The determine the Company’s peer companies, the following criteria was used: software or software-as-a-service companies; similar histories and relatively comparable financial leverage; sufficient public company trading history; similar talent pool; and in similar businesses and geographical markets. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period for awards, on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements— Recent accounting standards not included below are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2019: On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the lease guidance using a modified retrospective transition method applied to those leases which were not completed as of January 1, 2019. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2018 are presented under the new guidance, while prior period comparative amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historical guidance. The Company applied the new standard using the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance where the Company: • did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts contain a lease; • did not reassess the classification of existing leases; and • did not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. In addition, the Company elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases. The resulting impact, as of the adoption date, to the consolidated balance sheet of applying the new guidance in 2019 versus the prior guidance was an increase to right-of-use assets of $152.2 million, a decrease to other assets of $0.3 million, an increase to total assets of $151.9 million, an increase to short-term lease liabilities of $14.1 million, a decrease to accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $0.5 million, an increase to total current liabilities of $13.5 million, an increase to long-term lease liabilities of $164.8 million, a decrease to deferred rent, net of current portion of $26.4 million and an increase to total liabilities of $151.9 million. There was no impact to stockholders’ equity or the consolidated statements of operations as a result of adopting the new guidance. There was no impact to total operating or financing cash flows of applying the new guidance in 2019 versus the prior guidance other than renaming or adding line items to the statements of cash flows to conform to the accounting for, and presentation of, the new standard. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2020: In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under previous guidance, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test required entities to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The carrying value in excess of the implied fair value was recognized as goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, goodwill impairment is recognized based on Step 1 of the current guidance, which calculates the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. The guidance was adopted effective January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that introduces a new methodology for accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The guidance establishes a new forward-looking ""expected loss model"" that requires entities to estimate current expected credit losses on accounts receivable and other financial instruments by using all practical and relevant information. The guidance was adopted effective January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 73 In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the accounting for incomes taxes by removing (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items, (ii) the exception to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment, and (iii) the exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The guidance also improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas accounting for income taxes. The guidance was adopted effective January 1, 2020, using a prospective approach and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted in Future Periods: In August 2020, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being bifurcated from the host contract and separately recognized as compared with current GAAP. In addition, it eliminates the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the standard on its consolidated financial statements. 3. Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue The Company provides disaggregation of revenue based on geographic region (Note 10) and based on the subscription versus professional services and other classification on the consolidated statements of operations as it believes these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Deferred Revenue and Deferred Commission Expense Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue, and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term deferred revenue. Deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $82.4 million resulting from $965.4 million of calculated billings and was offset by revenue recognized of $883.0 million during the same period. $232.0 million of revenue was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $255.6 million of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for contracts with original performance obligations that exceed one year. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 93% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, with the balance recognized thereafter. Additional contract liabilities $1.7 million and $1.4 million were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which primarily consist of sales commissions paid for new subscription contracts, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of approximately one to three years. The one to three-year period has been determined by taking into consideration the type of product sold, the commitment term of the customer contract, the nature of the Company’s technology development life-cycle, and an estimated customer relationship period. Sales commissions for upgrade contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated customer relationship period of the related customer. Deferred commission expense that will be recorded as expense during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred commission expense, and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term deferred commission expense. Deferred commission expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $21.7 million as a result of deferring incremental costs of obtaining a contract of $65.6 million and was offset by amortization of $43.9 million during the same period. 4. Leases The Company leases office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through May 2031. Operating lease expense costs were $44.6 million in 2020 and $32.2 million in 2019. The Company subleases some of its unused spaces to third parties. Operating sublease income generated under all operating lease agreements for the year ended 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 74 Year ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Operating sublease income $ 5,000 $ 2,498 The following table provides a reconciliation between non-cancelable lease commitments and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020: Operating leases Lease commitments (Note 11) $ 388,962 Less: Legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced — Less: Present value discount (79,469 ) Total lease liabilities $ 309,493 Certain leases contain optional termination dates, and the Company is not reasonably certain to extend its lease agreements beyond those dates. The Company evaluates whether it will extend these lease agreements each reporting period and updates its lease liabilities accordingly. If the Company were to extend leases beyond the optional termination date, the future commitments would increase by approximately $90.8 million. Lease Term and Discount Rate The Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of operating lease payments. To determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, the Company uses publicly available credit ratings for peer companies. The Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments. The following table provides weighted average remaining lease terms and weighted average discount rate for operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2020: Weighted-average remaining lease term: 8.0 years Weighted-average discount rate: 5.3% Other Information Cash payments related to operating lease liabilities were $48.8 million in 2020 and $28.8 million in 2019. 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company measures certain financial assets at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. 75 The following table details the fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 : December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in thousands) Cash equivalents and investments: Money market funds $ 172,485 $ — $ — $ 172,485 Commercial paper — 12,233 — 12,233 Corporate bonds — 116,371 — 116,371 U.S. Treasury securities — 774,772 — 774,772 Certificates of deposit — 394 — 394 Restricted cash: Money market funds — 3,029 — 3,029 Total $ 172,485 $ 906,799 $ — $ 1,079,284 December 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in thousands) Cash equivalents and investments: Money market funds $ 96,618 $ — $ — $ 96,618 Commercial paper — 87,185 — 87,185 Corporate bonds — 87,138 — 87,138 U.S. Treasury securities — 631,174 — 631,174 Restricted cash: Certificates of deposit — 5,816 — 5,816 Money market funds — 3,029 — 3,029 Total $ 96,618 $ 814,342 $ — $ 910,960 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The fair value of the Company’s investments in certain money market funds is their face value and such instruments are classified as Level 1 and are included in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (within other long-term assets) on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Level 2 securities were priced by pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the 2022 Notes was $526.1 million and the fair value of the 2025 Notes was $718.8 million (Note 9). The fair value was determined based on the quoted price of the 2022 and 2025 Notes in an inactive market on the last trading day of the reporting period and has been classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, finance leases and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these balances. Restricted cash is comprised of money market funds and certificates of deposit related to landlord guarantees for leased facilities. These restricted cash balances have been excluded from our cash and cash equivalents balance on our consolidated balance sheets. Strategic investments consist of non-controlling equity investments in privately held companies. The Company elected the measurement alternative for these investments without readily determinable fair values and for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method of accounting, the non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost less any impairment, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, which is recorded within the statement of operations. The Company holds $6.7 million of strategic investments without readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2020 and $4.4 million of strategic investments without readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2019. These investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment of $250 thousand and there have been no adjustments to the carrying value of the strategic investments in 2019 or 2018. 76 The following tables summarize the composition of our short- and long-term investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019: December 31, 2020 Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Aggregate Fair Value (in thousands) Commercial paper $ 12,233 $ — $ — $ 12,233 Corporate bonds 115,983 427 (39 ) 116,371 U.S. Treasury securities 774,667 105 — 774,772 Certificates of deposit 394 — — 394 Total $ 903,277 $ 532 $ (39 ) $ 903,770 December 31, 2019 Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Aggregate Fair Value (in thousands) Commercial paper $ 77,214 $ — $ — $ 77,214 Corporate bonds 86,900 251 (13 ) 87,138 U.S. Treasury securities 581,066 207 (15 ) 581,258 Total $ 745,180 $ 458 $ (28 ) $ 745,610 For all of our securities for which the amortized cost basis was greater than the fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has concluded that there is no plan to sell the security nor is it more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. In making the determination as to whether the unrealized loss is other-than-temporary, the Company considered the length of time and extent the investment has been in an unrealized loss position, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, the issuers’ credit rating and the time to maturity. Contractual Maturities The contractual maturities of short-term and long-term investments held as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Amortized Cost Basis Aggregate Fair Value Amortized Cost Basis Aggregate Fair Value ( in thousands) Due within one year $ 872,637 $ 873,073 $ 691,556 $ 691,834 Due after 1 year and within 2 years 30,640 30,697 53,624 53,776 Total $ 903,277 $ 903,770 $ 745,180 $ 745,610 6.

The Company capitalized asset retirement costs of $4.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $3.3 million at December 31, 2019 within leasehold improvements and the related liability is within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These costs represent future lease restoration obligations as required by Company’s leases. The changes in the asset retirement obligation balance during the year ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Beginning balance $ 3,533 $ 1,424 Additions 750 2,028 Accretion 236 103 Updates to estimated cash flows 365 (22 ) Ending balance $ 4,884 $ 3,533 7. Business Acquisitions On October 31, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of PieSync, a Belgian-based technology company that operates an integration platform as a service (“iPaaS”) solution which continuously syncs customer data bi-directionally across various software applications. PieSync is one of the only iPaaS technologies that provides both a current and historical two-way sync of customer data that operates in the background, which will offer customers a more efficient way of managing multiple applications. The total cash purchase price for the acquisition was $23.3 million, net of cash acquired, which includes a working capital settlement of $0.3 million. Other liabilities assumed includes $333 thousand of debt, which the Company repaid in 2019. There was approximately $2.7 million of potential consideration that was not included in the purchase price allocation as it is not associated with pre-combination services. This potential additional payment is contingent upon post-acquisition employment and will be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations over a period of 2 years. Through December 31, 2020, $1.6 million of this consideration had been earned and recorded as operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The transaction costs associated with the acquisition were approximately $527 thousand and were recorded in general and administrative expense. The following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition: Fair value (in thousands) Cash $ 646 Accounts receivable 133 Other current and noncurrent assets 218 Acquired developed technology 9,800 Other intangible assets 70 Goodwill 15,219 Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities (731 ) Deferred revenue (210 ) Deferred tax liability (1,324 ) Total purchase price $ 23,821 The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company will derive significant value from this acquisition through synergies such as cross selling opportunities and a stronger platform that offers a suite of products not directly matched by competitors. The goodwill recognized is not deductible for foreign income tax purposes. The Company applied variations of the income approach to estimate the fair values of the intangible assets acquired. The primary intangible asset acquired in the business combination was developed technology and the fair value of the developed technology of $9.8 million was determined based on the estimated present value of expected after-tax cash flows attributable to the technology using an excess earnings method. The Company applied significant estimates and assumptions with respect to forecasted 78 revenue growth rates, the revenue attributable to the acquired intangible asset over its estimated economic life, and the discount rate. The fair values assigned to the other tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination were based on management’s estimates and assumptions. The Company began amortizing the acquired technology on the date of acquisition. The acquired technology is being amortized over seven years using a method reflective of the expected economic benefit consumption over the expected useful life of the asset. The weighted average amortization period for the acquired technology is approximately 4.3 years. The amortization expense is recorded to cost of subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has included the operating results of PieSync, which are not material, in its consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. The acquisition did not have a material effect on the revenue or earnings in the consolidated income statement for the reporting periods presented. The pro forma results of the Company as if the acquisition had taken place on the first day of 2018 were not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 8. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Intangible assets acquired through business combinations Intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consist of the following: Weighted Average Remaining Useful Life December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Acquired technology 40 Months $ 18,383 $ 17,297 Other intangible assets 9 Months 70 70 Accumulated amortization (8,171 ) (5,615 ) Total $ 10,282 $ 11,752 Other intangible assets include trade name and customer relationship. The estimated useful life of acquired technology is two to seven years. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $2.6 million in 2020, $3.2 million in 2019, and $1.4 million in 2018. Amortization expense of acquired technology is included in cost of subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Estimated future amortization expense for intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 is as follows: Years ended December 31, Amortization Expense (in thousands) 2021 $ 1,083 2022 1,406 2023 1,844 2024 2,150 2025 2,126 Thereafter 1,673 Total $ 10,282 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net assets acquired and is generally not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually. 79 The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill consist of the following: (in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 14,950 PieSync acquisition 15,219 Effect of foreign currency translation 81 Balance as of December 31, 2019 30,250 Effect of foreign currency translation 1,431 Measurement period adjustments (363 ) Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 31,318 9. Convertible Senior Notes 2025 Convertible Senior Notes and Capped Call Options In June 2020, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 0.375% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) in a private offering and an additional $60 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment options of the initial purchasers. The interest rate is fixed at 0.375% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The total net proceeds from the debt offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $450.1 million. Each $1,000 of principal amount of the 2025 Notes will initially be convertible into 3.5396 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion Option of the 2025 Notes”), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $282.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. On or after March 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2025 Notes at any time. The 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2025 under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2025 Notes (the “Indenture”). Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. The Company expects to settle the principal amount of the 2025 Notes in cash. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change prior to the maturity date, holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2025 Notes called for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as permitted by the Indenture. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the conditions allowing holders of the 2025 Notes to convert have not been met and are therefore not convertible during the year ended December 31, 2020. Because the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2025 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. As of February 12, 2021, no holders have converted or indicated their intention to convert the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are classified as long-term debt. In accounting for the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the Conversion Option was $98.7 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes. The equity component is recorded in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (the ""Debt Discount"") is amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 5.71% over the contractual term of the 2025 Notes. In accounting for the debt issuance costs of $9.9 million related to the 2025 Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2025 Notes based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were $7.8 million and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of the 2025 Notes. Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were $2.1 million and are netted with the equity component of the 2025 Notes in stockholders’ equity. The difference in the book and tax allocation between the liability and equity components of the 2025 Notes resulted in a difference between the carrying amount and tax basis of the 2025 Notes. This taxable temporary difference resulted in the Company 80 recognizing a deferred tax liability and a corresponding reduction in the Company's valuation allowance on its US deferred tax assets, resulting in no net deferred tax impact. The net carrying amount of the liability component of the 2025 Notes is as follows: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Principal $ 460,000 $ — Unamortized debt discount (88,756 ) — Unamortized issuance costs (6,973 ) — Net carrying amount $ 364,271 $ — The net carrying amount of the equity component of the 2025 Notes is as follows: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Debt discount for conversion option $ 98,730 $ — Issuance costs (2,120 ) — Net carrying amount $ 96,610 $ — Interest expense related to the 2025 Notes is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Contractual interest expense $ 987 $ — $ — Amortization of debt discount 9,974 — — Amortization of issuance costs 784 — — Total interest expense $ 11,745 $ — $ — In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, the Company purchased capped call options (“Capped Call Options”) with respect to its common stock for $50.6 million. The Capped Call Options are purchased call options that give the Company the option to purchase up to approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $282.52 per share, which corresponds to the approximate initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes. The Capped Call Options were purchased in order to offset potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 2025 Notes, subject to a cap of $426.44 per share, and expire concurrently with the 2025 Notes. The Capped Call Options automatically settle in components commencing on April 16, 2025 and are subject to either adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including a merger event; a tender offer; and a nationalization, insolvency or delisting involving the Company. In addition, the Capped Call Options are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Call Options, including changes in law, insolvency filings, and hedging disruptions. Since the transaction meets certain accounting criteria, the $50.6 million paid for the Capped Call Options is recorded in stockholders’ equity as a reduction in additional paid-in capital and are not accounted for as separate derivative financial instruments. 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant In May 2017, the Company issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) in a private offering and an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of such notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment options of the initial purchasers of the 2022 Notes. The interest rate is fixed at 0.25% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The total net proceeds from the debt offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $389.2 million. Each $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes are currently convertible into 10.5519 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion Option of the 2022 Notes”), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $94.77 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. On or after February 1, 2022 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time. The 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 1, 2022 under certain circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. The Company expects to settle the principal amount of the 2022 Notes in cash. Because the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company settled $2 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash. Between the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and February 12, 2021, the Company additionally settled $8.3 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash in response to conversion notices received prior to December 31, 2020. As of February 12, 2021, the Company has received additional conversion notices subsequent to year-end for approximately $36.1 million of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes, which will be settled in cash during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. 81 The 2022 Notes are classified as long-term debt, except for $7.8 million classified as current as of December 31, 2020 for conversion notices received prior to year-end, for which the principal amount is expected to be cash-settled within the next fiscal quarter. The equity component of the 2022 Notes will continue to be classified as additional paid-in capital because the Company has the option to settle the principal amount in shares and the maturity date of the 2022 Notes is more than 12 months away. However, it is the Company’s intent to settle the principal amount of the 2022 Notes in cash. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Convertible Note Hedges”) with certain counterparties in which the Company has the option to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) up to approximately 4.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of approximately $94.77 per share. The Convertible Note Hedges will be settled in cash or shares, or any combination thereof, in accordance with the settlement method of the 2022 Notes in excess of the par amount, and are expected to settle concurrently with the conversion of the 2022 Notes. The total cost of the Convertible Note Hedges was $78.9 million. In addition, the Company sold warrants (the “Warrants”) to certain bank counterparties whereby the holders of the Warrants have the option to initially purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 4.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $115.8 per share. The amount by which the settlement price exceeds the strike price may be settled in shares or cash at the Company’s election. The Warrants are expected to settle three business days from each trading day commencing on September 1, 2022 and ending on the 79th trading day thereafter. The Company received $58.9 million in cash proceeds, net of issuance costs of $200 thousand, from the sale of these Warrants. The purchase of the Convertible Note Hedges and the sale of Warrants is intended to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $94.77 to $115.83 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the net $20.0 million paid for the Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants is recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as separate derivative financial instruments. In June 2020, the Company used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes for the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes, which consisted of a repurchase of $272.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $283.0 in cash and approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock at $207.17 per share. Of the $613.5 million in aggregate consideration, $248.7 million was allocated to the fair value of the debt component of the repurchase, and $364.8 million was allocated to the equity component (the associated Conversion Option of the 2022 Notes) of the repurchases, utilizing a discount rate of 4.9% to determine the fair value of the liability component. This rate was based on the Company’s estimated borrowing rate for a similar liability with the same maturity, but without the associated conversion option. To derive this effective discount rate, the Company utilized observable market rates for liabilities with similar estimated credit characteristics. As of the partial repurchase date, the carrying value of the 2022 Notes subject to the 2022 Notes partial repurchase, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, was $238.2 million. The 2022 Notes partial repurchase and issuance of the 2025 Notes were deemed to have substantially different terms due to the significant difference between the value of the conversion option immediately prior to and after the exchange, and accordingly, the 2022 Notes partial repurchase was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The 2022 Notes partial repurchase resulted in a $10.5 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, which is recorded within interest expense on the Company’s statements of operations. The loss on extinguishment was determined by comparing the consideration attributed to the fair value of the debt component with the carrying value of the debt component, which includes the proportionate amounts of unamortized debt discount and the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes, the consideration allocated to the equity component of $364.8 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company also reversed a corresponding portion of the associated deferred tax liability and increased the Company’s valuation allowance on its US deferred tax assets, resulting in no net deferred tax impact. As of December 31, 2020, $125.8 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2022 Notes. In connection with the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes, the Company terminated Convertible Note Hedges corresponding to approximately 2.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for cash consideration of $362.5 million, and certain counterparties terminated Warrants corresponding to approximately 2.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for cash consideration of $327.6 million. The net proceeds of $34.9 million received from these transactions were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.

Segment Information and Geographic Data As more fully described in the Company’s Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company operates in one operating segment. Revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region, based on physical location of the operations recording the sale or the assets are as follows: Revenues by geographical region: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (In thousands) Americas $ 568,365 $ 456,568 $ 361,136 Europe 243,811 168,452 117,670 Asia Pacific 70,850 49,840 34,174 Total $ 883,026 $ 674,860 $ 512,980 Percentage of revenues generated outside of the Americas 36 % 32 % 30 % Revenue derived from customers outside the United States (international) was approximately 43% of total revenue in 2020, 40% of total revenue in 2019 and 37% of total revenue in 2018. 83 Total long-lived assets by geographical region: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 (In thousands) Americas $ 206,789 $ 175,821 Europe 159,338 127,395 Asia Pacific 10,889 14,823 Total long lived assets $ 377,016 $ 318,039 Percentage of long lived assets held outside of the Americas 45 % 45 % 11. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases its office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through May 2031. Rent expense for non-cancellable operating leases with free rental periods or scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Improvement reimbursements from landlords of $21.8 million are being amortized on a straight-line basis into rent expense over the terms of the corresponding leases. Certain leases contain optional termination dates. The table below only includes payments up to the optional termination date. If the Company were to extended leases beyond the optional termination date the future commitments would increase by approximately $90.8 million. Future minimum payments under all operating lease agreements as of December 31, 2020, are as follows: Operating (in thousands) 2021 $ 51,933 2022 50,449 2023 49,994 2024 48,617 2025 48,686 Thereafter 139,283 Total $ 388,962 The Company has entered into certain non-cancelable arrangements (“Vendor Commitments”), which require the future purchase of goods or services. Future minimum payments under all Vendor Commitments as of December 31, 2020, are as follows: Product related obligations INBOUND event obligations (in thousands) 2021 $ 31,138 $ - 2022 48,140 316 2023 22,150 653 2024 — — 2025 — — Total $ 101,428 $ 969 In December 2020, the Company committed to invest $12.5 million in the Black Economic Development Fund managed by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation to support Black-led financial institutions, community centers, anchor institutions, and business transactions. Legal Contingencies From time to time the Company may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that 84 the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 12. Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is reported as a component of stockholders’ equity, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Cumulative Translation Adjustment Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Total (in thousands) Beginning balance at January 1, 2019 $ (397 ) $ (326 ) $ (723 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications (213 ) 600 387 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — — — Ending balance at December 31, 2019 $ (610 ) $ 274 $ (336 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 4,790 149 4,939 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — — — Ending balance at December 31, 2020 $ 4,180 $ 423 $ 4,603 13. Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-Based Compensation Common Stock Reserved — As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has authorized 500 million shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock reserved for the vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and exercise of common stock options are as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 RSUs 1,561 1,529 Common stock options 1,020 1,494 2,581 3,023 For shares reserved for issuance for the Conversion Options, Warrants and Capped Call Options of the Notes, see Note 9. Equity Incentive Plan —The Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”) was terminated in connection with the IPO, and accordingly, no shares are available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan will continue to govern outstanding awards granted thereunder, the 2007 Plan provided for the grant of qualified incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options or other awards such as RSUs to the Company’s employees, officers, directors and outside consultants. The term of each option is fixed by the Company’s compensation committee and may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2020, 472 thousand options to purchase common stock and no RSUs remained outstanding under the 2007 Plan. On September 25, 2014, the Company’s board of directors adopted and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The 2014 Plan became effective upon the closing of the Company’s IPO in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company initially reserved 1,973,551 shares of its common stock, or the Initial Limit, for the issuance of awards under the 2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the plan automatically increases each January 1, by 5% of the outstanding number of shares of the Company’s common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares as determined by the compensation committee. This number is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Company’s capitalization. The term of each option is fixed by the Company’s compensation committee and may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2020, 549 thousand options to purchase common stock and 1.6 million RSUs remained outstanding under the 2014 Plan. Equity Compensation Expense —The Company’s equity compensation expense is comprised of awards of options to purchase common stock, RSUs, and stock issued under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). 85 The following two tables show stock compensation expense by award type and where the stock compensation expense is recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 ( in thousands) Options $ 6,377 $ 5,078 $ 5,108 ESPP 6,850 4,866 2,833 RSUs 108,261 87,810 68,320 Total stock-based compensation $ 121,488 $ 97,754 $ 76,261 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Cost of revenue, subscription $ 4,408 $ 3,127 $ 1,476 Cost of revenue, service 2,536 2,829 2,924 Research and development 39,366 33,748 23,328 Sales and marketing 50,552 36,599 31,099 General and administrative 24,626 21,451 17,434 Total stock-based compensation $ 121,488 $ 97,754 $ 76,261 Excluded from stock-based compensation expense is $3.6 million of capitalized software development costs in 2020, $2.4 million in 2019, and $2.4 million in 2018. Stock Options —The fair value of employee options is estimated on the date of each grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.47-1.66 1.95-2.55 2.62-2.85 Expected term (years) 5.50-6.24 5.50-6.02 5.06-6.42 Volatility (%) 38.15-40.63 39.46-41.41 41.34-43.55 Expected dividends — — — The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted was $70.98 per share in 2020, $69.44 per share in 2019, and $51.48 per share in 2018. The interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate at the date of grant with a maturity approximately equal to the expected term. The expected term of options granted to employees was calculated using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted-average vesting period of the option. The expected volatility for the Company’s common stock was based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of similar public companies. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures of share-based awards prior to vesting results in a reversal of previously recorded stock-compensation expense associated with such forfeited awards. The fair value of the Company’s common stock is the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows: Options (in thousands) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Life (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding—January 1, 2020 1,494 $ 33.09 4.0 $ 187,398 Granted 111 183.25 Exercised (580 ) 17.16 Forfeited/expired (5 ) 145.4 Outstanding—December 31, 2020 1,020 57.98 4.4 $ 345,144 Options vested or expected to vest—December 31, 2020 1,020 $ 57.98 4.4 $ 345,144 Options exercisable—December 31, 2020 828 $ 34.85 3.5 $ 299,266 86 Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested options was $9.8 million at December 31, 2020. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years as of December 31, 2020. Restricted Stock Units —RSUs vest upon achievement of a service condition. The service condition is a time-based condition met over a period of four years, with 25% met after one year, and then in equal monthly or quarterly installments over the succeeding three years, or over a period of four years, with equal quarterly installments over those four years. As soon as practicable following each vesting date, the Company will issue to the holder of the RSUs the number of shares of common stock equal to the aggregate number of RSUs that have vested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, in lieu of issuing shares of common stock to the holder of the RSUs, pay the holder an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such shares of common stock. . The total stock-based compensation expense expected to be recorded over the remaining life of outstanding RSUs is approximately $213.4 million at December 31, 2020. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. As of December 31, 2020, there are 1.6 million RSUs expected to vest with an aggregate intrinsic value of $618.5 million. The total fair value of RSUs vested was approximately $101.2 million in 2020, $85.2 million in 2019, and $65.0 million in 2018. The following table summarizes the activity related to RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020: RSUs Outstanding Shares (in thousands) Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Unvested and outstanding at January 1, 2020 1,529 $ 119.46 Granted 1,035 169.79 Vested (880 ) 115.01 Canceled (123 ) 137.73 Unvested and outstanding at December 31, 2020 1,561 $ 153.91 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)— The ESPP authorizes the issuance of up to a total of 2,005,274 shares of common stock to participating employees and allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from the fair market value of the stock as determined on specific dates at six-month intervals. The offering periods for the ESPP commence on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The fair value of employee options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.14-1.60 2.56 1.61-2.10 Expected term (years) 0.50 0.50 0.42-0.50 Volatility (%) 34.75-67.22 41.32-45.07 28.45-28.81 Expected dividends — — — The interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate at the date of grant with a maturity approximately equal to the expected term. The expected term is based on the offering period. The expected volatility for the Company’s common stock was based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of similar public companies. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The fair value of the Company’s common stock is the closing price of the stock on the date the offering period starts. The following table summarizes the activity related to ESPP: Shares Issued (in thousands) Weighted- Average Purchase Price Total Cash Proceeds (in thousands) 2020 132 $ 149.23 $ 19,653 2019 116 $ 123.69 $ 14,383 2018 148 $ 80.21 $ 11,863 87 14. Income Taxes Loss before provision for income taxes was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) United States $ (96,555 ) $ (63,200 ) $ (69,769 ) Foreign 15,740 12,427 7,809 Total $ (80,815 ) $ (50,773 ) $ (61,960 ) The (provision) benefit for income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Current income tax provision Federal $ (406 ) $ (238 ) $ (184 ) State (487 ) (241 ) (140 ) Foreign (5,508 ) (3,293 ) (1,508 ) Total current income tax provision (6,401 ) (3,772 ) (1,832 ) Deferred income tax benefit Federal (116 ) 160 21 State — — — Foreign 2,301 639 (57 ) Total deferred income tax benefit (expense) 2,185 799 (36 ) Total income tax provision $ (4,216 ) $ (2,973 ) $ (1,868 ) The following reconciles the differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the provision for income taxes: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Expected income tax benefit at the federal statutory rate $ 16,899 $ 10,665 $ 12,955 State taxes net of federal benefit 4,618 3,700 5,155 Stock-based compensation 25,196 16,055 17,575 Executive compensation limitation (3,004 ) (7,244 ) — Difference in foreign tax rates 830 693 435 U.S. tax credits 11,529 24,170 1,763 GILTI inclusion — (1,645 ) (1,177 ) Meals and entertainment (478 ) (1,208 ) (1,411 ) Change in valuation allowance (62,182 ) (47,523 ) (37,059 ) Other 2,376 (636 ) (104 ) Income tax benefit (provision) $ (4,216 ) $ (2,973 ) $ (1,868 ) On December 22, 2017, the United States of America signed tax legislation (the “2017 Act”) which enacted a wide range of changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The 2017 Act reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, broadened the tax base and changes rules for expensing and capitalizing business expenditures, established a territorial tax system for foreign earnings as well as a minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, provided for a one-time transition tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings, and introduced new rules for the treatment of certain export sales. In 2020, the Company reversed the 2019 recognized tax benefit under the item-by-item method and recorded a tax expense of $116 thousand. 88 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities —Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 190,555 $ 142,512 Research and investment credits 46,729 35,285 Accruals and reserves 15,278 9,239 Depreciation 2,223 1,756 Intangible assets 164 — Stock-based compensation 7,354 5,451 Interest expense 8,650 3,197 Total deferred tax assets 270,953 197,440 Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets (2,546 ) (2,678 ) Convertible debt (21,873 ) (3,550 ) Capitalized costs (17,009 ) (11,351 ) Depreciation (231 ) (138 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (41,659 ) (17,717 ) Valuation allowance (227,062 ) (180,092 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 2,232 $ (369 ) The Company reviews all available evidence to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including its recent history of accumulated losses over the most recent three years as well as its ability to generate income in future periods. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized given the nature of the assets and the likelihood of future utilization. The valuation allowance increased by $47.0 million in 2020, $47.3 million in 2019 and $36.1 million in 2018, primarily due to the increase in the U.S. net operating loss deferred tax asset. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its valuation allowance positions within the next 12 months. Prior to the 2017 Act, the Company had asserted that the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. In 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the impact of the 2017 Act and determined that it would no longer assert indefinite reinvestment of its foreign earnings. Earnings through December 31, 2017 have been subject to U.S. federal income tax via the one-time transition tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings. The 2017 Act eliminated the U.S. federal income tax cost for qualified repatriation beginning in 2018. The Company has determined that any incremental tax incurred upon ultimate distribution of these earnings to the U.S. would not be material. The Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $760 million and $508 million at December 31, 2020 and $568 million and $379 million at December 31, 2019. The Company also had international net operating loss carryforwards of $8 million at December 31, 2020 and $6 million at December 31, 2019. As a result of the 2017 Act all federal net operating losses, created after January 1, 2018, have an indefinite carryforward period. All federal net operating losses, created before January 1, 2018, are subject to a 20 year carryforward period and will expire at various dates through 2037. State net operating losses will expire at various dates through 2040. The Company has a federal interest expense carryforward of $35.2 million at December 31, 2020, and $13.0 million at December 31, 2019, which have an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had federal research and development credit carryforwards of $31.0 million at December 31, 2020 that expire at various dates through 2040. The Company also has state research and investment tax credit carryforwards of $15.7 million, that expire at various dates through 2035. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in the Company's ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. 89 Uncertain Tax Positions —The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on technical merit. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The following summarizes activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Unrecognized benefit—beginning of the year $ 5,445 $ 3,925 $ 2,725 Gross increases—current period positions 3,003 2,387 1,200 Gross decrease—prior period positions — (867 ) — Unrecognized benefit—end of period $ 8,448 $ 5,445 $ 3,925 All of the gross unrecognized tax benefits represent a reduction to the research and development tax credit carryforward. The gross decrease to prior period positions is a result of the Company completing its documentation of credits generated between 2015 and 2018. All of the unrecognized tax benefits decrease deferred tax assets with a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance. None of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized in the future. The Company has elected to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded through December 31, 2020 because the Company has no tax due because of significant NOL carryforwards. The Company does not expect any significant change in its unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. The Company files tax returns in the United States and various jurisdictions throughout the world where the Company has operations or established a taxable presence. All of the Company’s tax years remain open to examination in the United States, as carryforward attributes generated in past years may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities if they have or will be used in future periods. The Company remains open to examination for varying periods in the other foreign jurisdictions and is routinely examined by various taxing authorities. 15. Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a defined contribution savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers certain employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pretax basis, subject to legal limitations. Total employer contributions were $5.9 million in 2020, $4.8 million in 2019, and $4.0 million in 2018. 16. Subsequent Event On February 8, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding equity securities of Hustle Con Media, Inc. (the “Hustle”) for approximately $20 million. The Hustle is a media company that produces a newsletter, podcast, and premium research content for innovative professionals. 90 17.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2020 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. (b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is included under Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 92 (c) Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. (d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Guidewire’s platform combines core operations, digital engagement, analytics, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) applications delivered as a cloud service or self-managed software. As a partner to our customers, we continually evolve to enable their success and assist them in navigating a rapidly changing insurance market.Our core operational services and products are InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud, InsuranceNow, and InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations. These services and products are transactional systems of record that support the entire insurance lifecycle, including insurance product definition, distribution, underwriting, policyholder services, and claims management. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is a highly configurable and scalable product, delivered as a service and primarily comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be subscribed to separately or together. These applications are built on and optimized for our Guidewire Cloud Platform (“GWCP”) architecture and leverage our in-house Guidewire Cloud operations team. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is designed to support multiple releases each year to ensure that cloud customers remain on the latest version and gain fast access to our innovation efforts. Additionally, InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud embeds digital and analytics capabilities natively into our platform. Most new sales and implementations are for InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud. InsuranceNow is a complete, cloud-based application that offers policy, billing, and claims management functionality to insurers that have limited internal information technology resources. InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations is comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be licensed separately or together and can be deployed and updated by our customers and their implementation partners. Our digital engagement applications enable digital sales, omni-channel service, and enhanced claims experiences for policyholders, agents, vendor partners, and field personnel. Our Analytics and AI offerings enable insurers to manage data more effectively, gain insights into their business, drive operational efficiencies, and underwrite new and evolving risks. To support P&C insurers globally, we have localized, and will continue to localize, our platform for use in a variety of international regulatory, language, and currency environments.Our customers range from some of the largest global insurance companies or their subsidiaries to predominantly national or local insurers that serve specific states and/or regions. Our customer engagement is led by our direct sales team and supported by our system integrator (“SI”) partners. We maintain and continue to grow our sales and marketing efforts globally, and maintain regional sales centers throughout the world. Because our platform is critical to our new and existing customers’ businesses, their decision-making and product evaluation process is long, which results in an extended sales cycle. These evaluation periods can extend further if a customer purchases multiple services and products or assesses the benefits of a cloud-based subscription. Sales to new customers also involve extensive customer due diligence and reference checks. The success of our sales efforts relies on continued improvements and enhancements to our current services and products, the introduction of new services and products, efficient operation of our cloud infrastructure, continued development of relevant local content and automated tools for updating content, and successful implementations. We sell our cloud-delivered offerings through subscription services and our self-managed products through term licenses. We generally price our services and products based on the amount of direct written premium (“DWP”) that will be managed by our platform. Our subscription, term license, and support fees are typically invoiced annually in advance. Subscription services are generally sold with an initial term of between three and five years with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. Subscription revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the committed term, once all revenue recognition criteria is met including providing access to the service. Term licenses are primarily sold with an initial two-year committed term with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. We may enter into term license arrangements with our customers that have an initial term of more than two years or may renew license arrangements for longer than one year. A small portion of our revenue is derived from perpetual licenses. Term and perpetual license revenue are typically recognized when software is made available to a customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our support revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed support term of the licensed software. Our support fees are typically priced as a fixed percentage of the associated license fees. We also offer professional services, both directly and through SI partners, to help our customers deploy, migrate, and utilize our services, products, and platform. Substantially all of our services revenue is billed monthly on a time and materials basis.We began our principal business operations in 2001. Industry BackgroundTable of ContentsThe P&C insurance industry is large, fragmented, highly regulated, and complex. It is also highly competitive, with insurers competing primarily on product differentiation, pricing options, customer service, marketing and advertising, affiliate programs, and channel strategies.P&C insurers modernize their transactional core systems to manage key functional areas of P&C insurance, including product definition, underwriting and policy administration, claims management, and billing. Product definition specifies the insurance coverage, pricing, and financial and legal terms of insurance policies. Underwriting and policy administration includes collecting information from potential policyholders, determining appropriate coverages and terms, pricing policies, issuing policies, and updating and maintaining policies over their lifetimes. Claims management includes loss intake, investigation and evaluation of incidents, settlement negotiation, vendor management, litigation management, and payment processing. Billing includes policyholder invoicing, payment collection, and agent commission calculation. We believe insurers that adopt modern core systems can enhance customer experience, operate more efficiently, and introduce innovative services and products more rapidly.We believe the P&C insurance industry is experiencing accelerating change in how insurers engage with, sell to, and manage relationships with individual and business customers. Today, P&C insurers are striving to respond to significant changes in their competitive marketplace and the character of the risks they underwrite. The most significant changes include: •an industry rapidly going through change that requires agility and efficiency from its core systems;•a rise in customer expectations for digital, mobile, and omni-channel interaction rather than the traditional agent model;•a need for 100% digital engagement capabilities;•a growth in demand for personalized services and products;•an increase in technology and market-driven changes in vehicular risk;•demand for coverage of emerging risks such as terrorism, cybersecurity, pandemic, and reputational risk;•a wealth of data and desire to harness data to improve and grow business;•advances in the use of data and analytics to better market to and engage with customers, price policies, and manage claims;•development of opportunities to compete or partner with non-traditional players that offer disruptive technology-based value propositions;•established industry leaders are facing increased competition from new entrants in the market, including insurtech companies; and•the introduction and leveraging of new technologies, such as drones, artificial intelligence, the “Internet of Things,” chatbots, and telematics.Many of these trends, such as digital engagement capabilities and data analytics, have increased in importance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to these trends, changes, challenges, and opportunities, we believe that the P&C insurance industry is entering a phase of increasing investment in technology, characterized by investments in systems that increase agility and enhance digital engagement and analytics offerings. While each insurer may have different goals and priorities when pursuing new technology investments, there are several major themes that we believe guide these investments: •Digital Engagement Models. We believe that insurers will need to provide a more intuitive, digital user experience to reduce the risk of customer dissatisfaction and loss. Investment in digital user experience will allow insurers to deepen their engagement with customers and transition from passive and transactional customer interactions to active and advisory relationships. This transition will require investments in software services and products that are designed to model user journeys and enable more frequent, informed, and dynamic interactions between insurers and their customers. We believe these efforts can improve financial performance for insurers through increased lead conversions and lower customer churn. •Cloud-Delivered Solutions. We believe that increased recognition of the compelling economic benefits of deploying software solutions on public infrastructure combined with increased confidence in the security and reliability of such platforms will cause more insurers to consider cloud-deployed solutions. Insurers benefit from an optimized division of labor and risk, allowing third parties to manage their infrastructure as they focus on competitively differentiating activities.Table of Contents•Data Driven Decision-Making. Insurers are seeking to explore, visualize, and analyze proprietary and third-party data to optimize decision-making across the insurance lifecycle. We believe that such predictive analytical solutions are most effective when they provide predictive scores and other analytical insights to insurers’ employees as they perform their underwriting and claims management activities. Insurers may also apply data and machine learning to automate certain tasks whenever possible, thereby enabling efficiencies, such as straight-through processing, that lessen the burden on subject matter experts. •Innovation. Insurers are under pressure to innovate across their product lifecycle in order to grow their business and improve service quality. Examples of focus areas include creating services and products to target under-insured risks such as cyber, supply chain disruption, and reputational risk and partnering with insurtech providers to streamline operations and improve service to policyholders and agents. •Legacy System Modernization. A significant portion of the market continues to rely on legacy systems. We believe new claims, policy management, and billing systems will continue to be adopted as insurers that rely on legacy systems seek to gain operating efficiencies, expand into new markets and lines of business, and introduce new digital and data offerings. ProductsGuidewire is designed to be the platform insurers trust in order to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently. Our platform combines core operations, digital engagement, analytics, and AI applications, so that insurers can increase revenue, reduce operational costs and losses, improve pricing, and engage with a customer base that increasingly demands mobile and automated forms of self-service and communication. We are investing in research and development to accelerate improvements in our cloud platform services, products, and marketplace to better serve our customers.Core Operational Services and ProductsWe offer the following core operational services and products: Guidewire InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud, Guidewire InsuranceNow, and Guidewire InsuranceSuite for Self-Managed.Guidewire InsuranceSuite via Guidewire CloudGuidewire InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is comprised of three primary applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) optimized for our GWCP architecture.

We have increased the scope of our platform and business through internal development and acquisitions. This growing scope has required greater investment in the development of application interfaces and shared services necessary to unify the operations and user experience across our applications. To meet the anticipated increased demand for cloud-delivered solutions, we have increased investments to leverage the growing number of technology services provided by Amazon through AWS. The shift to cloud-delivered solutions has also required significant focus in improving our ability to manage, secure, and operate our applications since our cloud-based deployments, unlike our self-managed implementations, shift many operational responsibilities to us. Finally, we continue to improve the scalability of our service, which performs millions of complex, business-critical transactions daily. The accuracy and availability of our services must be maintained not only during normal business operations, but also during extraordinary events such as catastrophes, which may result in extremely high transaction volume in a short period of time. ServicesTable of ContentsWe provide implementation, cloud migration, and integration services to help our customers realize the benefits of our cloud-based services and software products.

As of July 31, 2021, we had 1,860 employees in the United States and 1,082 employees internationally.Attracting, Developing, and Retaining EmployeesOur recruiting, development, and retention objectives focus on attracting skilled and engaged employees who contribute the talent and diverse perspectives critical to our innovative, forward-looking, and inclusive workforce. Our recruiting process actively sources diverse talent and is designed to reduce bias, supporting our ability to hire candidates with professional qualifications, personal potential, and differing perspectives. Our flexible work policies expand our ability to hire and retain talent in geographies where we do not have physical offices. Fostering career progression by encouraging regular professional education empowers our employees to pursue their professional goals, which is critical to developing and retaining our employees. We invest in broad-based development for all of our employees in various ways such as skills-building programs, on-demand learning options, mentoring programs, and leadership development courses. In an effort to create more development opportunities for all employees, we are currently expanding our intern, mentoring, and leadership development programs. We gauge progress and efficacy, identify opportunities for change, and pursue solutions through tracking and analyzing data from various sources such as annual talent reviews and our progress toward hiring/promotion goals in our development, diversity and inclusion plans.Diversity, Inclusion, and BelongingWe believe that understanding and respecting another’s perspective, experience, background, and beliefs provides an opportunity to expand horizons, challenge complacency, and foster empathy. Diversity of perspective, experience, background, and beliefs fuel our innovative, collaborative, and engaged workplace. Realizing greater ethnic, racial, and gender diversity across all levels of our organization is, and will continue to be, an ongoing journey. We aim for the highest standards of fairness and equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, promotions, job assignments, and compensation. Some of our initiatives to create greater diversity and belonging among our employees include inclusive recruiting and outreach programs for diverse candidates, employee resource groups, and management-led listening circles.Positive Corporate CultureOur employees are critical to our success, and we believe creating a positive, inclusive culture is essential to attracting and retaining engaged employees.

We incorporate a wide variety of communication and training activities to encourage collaboration amongst our colleagues around the world. We measure the program’s efficacy and identify opportunities for improvements through an engagement survey distributed approximately every two years, with the last survey completed in April 2021.Health and WellnessWe believe a healthy, engaged, and high-performing workforce is part of our competitive advantage. We want all of our employees to thrive, and we regularly re-evaluate how to best support our employees’ wellness, health, and safety through benefits and resources. Our current benefit and wellness programs drive engagement that positively impacts our culture, job satisfaction, recruiting, and retention programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our physical, mental, and family health programs and informational outreach through professional development opportunities and personal empowerment, safe and healthy workspaces, wellness initiatives (including physical, emotional, and mental health), fair compensation, benefits, and recognition. Additionally, we have announced our intention to transition to a hybrid work environment in which a significant portion of our workforce will work either in-person on a part-time basis or remotely on a permanent basis. Labor RelationsTable of Contents Our employees in the United States are not represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign locations, there are workers’ councils that represent our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We recognize the critical role that our supervisors and managers play in fostering a productive, inclusive and respectful work environment, and we encourage employees to work directly with their supervisors, where possible, to efficiently and effectively resolve workplace concerns. We also respect our employees’ rights to voluntarily establish and join unions and similar associations without unlawful interference. We strive to work collaboratively with the councils and associations that represent our workers.CustomersWe market and sell our services and products to a wide variety of global P&C insurers ranging from some of the largest global insurers to national and regional companies.

We focus on developing and maintaining our customer relationships through customer service and account management. Customers are defined as entities that have placed orders for our services or products. In some instances, a parent corporation can have multiple entities, or insurance brands, that place orders for our services or products.

Strategic RelationshipsWe have extensive relationships with SI, consulting, technology, and industry partners. Our network of partners has expanded as interest in and adoption of our platform has grown. We encourage our partners to co-market, pursue joint sales initiatives, and drive broader adoption of our technology, helping us grow our business more efficiently and enabling us to focus our resources on continued innovation and further enhancement of our solutions.We work closely with our network of third-party SI partners to facilitate new sales and implementations of both our subscription services and self-managed products. Our partnerships with leading SI partners allow us to increase efficiency and scale while reducing customer implementation costs. We continue to invest time and resources to increase the number of qualified consultants employed by our SI partners, develop relationships with new partners in existing and new markets, and ensure that all SI partners are qualified to assist with implementing our services and products. We believe this model will continue to serve us well, and we intend to continue to expand our network of partners and the number of certified consultants with whom we work so we can leverage our SI partners more effectively, especially for future subscription implementations. As part of our PartnerConnect alliance program, we have a community of Solution Partners developing integrations that enable software and insurance business solutions to interoperate with our services and products.

Our strong relationships with leading system integrators enhance our direct sales through co-marketing efforts and by providing additional market validation of the distinctiveness and quality of our offerings.Table of ContentsResearch and DevelopmentOur research and development efforts focus on enhancing our platform, services, and products to meet the complex requirements of P&C insurers with a focus on capabilities, operational efficiency, data analytics, security, and privacy in the cloud. These efforts are intended to help our customers improve their operations; drive greater digital engagement with their customers, agents, and brokers; and gather, store and analyze data to improve business decisions. We also invest significantly in developing our services and products and necessary integrations to meet the market requirements, including regulations, language, currency, and local terminology, of each country or state in which our customers operate. This market-segment specific functionality must be updated regularly in order to stay current with regulatory changes in each market. We rely on a multi-national engineering team, which has grown organically and through acquisitions. CompetitionThe software market that caters to the P&C insurance industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Increased spending by insurers on software solutions and the emergence of new platforms that have broadened from core system modernization to new digital engagement and data and analytics solutions have generated significant interest among investors and entrepreneurs. Increased capital allows market participants, or potential market participants such as insurtech companies, to adopt more aggressive go-to-market strategies, improve existing services or products, introduce new services or products, develop innovative solutions that disrupt the market, and consolidate with other vendors. This market is also subject to changing technology preferences, shifting customer needs, and the adoption of cloud deployed solutions. These factors create an environment of increasing competition. Our current and future competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the services or products they offer. As we expand our product portfolio, we may begin to compete with software and service providers we have not traditionally competed against. Our current competitors include, but are not limited to, customers’ internally developed proprietary solutions; P&C insurance software vendors such as Duck Creek, EIS Group, Insurity, Majesco, Prima Solutions, RGI, and Sapiens; and horizontal software vendors such as SAP and Salesforce, which acquired Vlocity in 2020.Competitive factors in our industry depend on the product being offered and the size, geographic market, and line of business of potential customers. The principal competitive factors include product functionality, performance, customer references, total cost of ownership, solution completeness, implementation track record, security and in-depth knowledge of the P&C insurance industry. We typically compete favorably on the basis of these factors in most geographies.Intellectual PropertyThe software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and to protect against third-party claims and litigation related to intellectual property. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections. We own or have pending patents and patent applications, which generally apply to our software. Our owned patents have expiration dates starting in 2025. We also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks, as well as pending applications for such registrations, in order to protect our brand both in the United States and internationally.Our investments in services and partners are designed to ensure customer success by committing additional resources to both cloud-based and self-managed implementation projects. Our investments in cloud operations are focused on managing the infrastructure for our cloud-based customers in a secure, efficient, and cost-effective manner.Information about Segment and Geographic RevenueInformation about geographic revenue is set forth in Note 2 and information about segment reporting is set forth in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Seasonality We have experienced seasonal variations in our license revenue and, to a lesser extent, in our subscription revenue as a result of increased customer orders in our fourth fiscal quarter. We generally see significantly increased orders in our fourth fiscal quarter, which is the quarter ending July 31, due to efforts by our sales team to achieve annual incentives. Because we recognize revenue upfront for new term licenses and multi-year renewals compared to over time for subscription services, changes in the mix between term license and subscription services may impact our quarterly results. Additionally, any quarter in which a significant multi-year term license or multi-year term license renewal or non-renewal occurs could be impacted. For Table of Contentsexample, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we experienced license revenue growth due to a five-year term license renewal under which revenue was recognized upfront, which overshadowed the comparison with our second fiscal quarter of 2021 and may create a challenging comparable period for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Additionally, as subscriptions increase as a percentage of total sales, the revenue we can recognize in the initial fiscal year of an order will be reduced, deferred revenue will increase, and our reported revenue growth will be adversely affected in the near term due to the ratable nature of these arrangements. The concentration of our sales in our fiscal fourth quarter increases this impact as the revenue impact of most fiscal fourth quarter subscription sales will not be realized until the following fiscal year.Our services revenue is also subject to seasonal fluctuations, though to a lesser degree than our license revenue and subscription revenue. Our services revenue is impacted by the number of billable days in a given fiscal quarter. The fiscal quarter ending January 31 usually has fewer billable days due to the impact of the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s holidays. The fiscal quarter ending July 31 usually has fewer billable days due to the impact of vacations taken by our services professionals. Because we pay our services professionals the same amount throughout the year, our gross margins on our services revenue are usually lower in these quarters. This seasonal pattern, however, may be absent in any given year.

You should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other public filings. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings. In addition, if any of the following risks and uncertainties, or if any other risks and uncertainties, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed substantially, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryThe global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations, and financial condition.The COVID-19 pandemic and related adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, have adversely affected and are continuing to adversely affect workforces, organizations, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to economic downturns and increased market volatility. Our business and financial results during fiscal year 2021, including our ARR growth rates, services revenue, and margins, were adversely impacted due to the disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic, as well as measures undertaken to contain the spread of COVID-19, have affected and could further affect our ability to travel to customers and prospects, resulting in delays in services delivery, delays in implementations, and interruptions or modifications in our sales and marketing activities, including Connections, our annual user conference, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly if there are periods of increases in the number of COVID-19 cases or future variants of the virus in areas in which we operate. The pandemic has also disrupted the normal operations of our customers’ businesses and our SI partners’ businesses. The related impacts of the pandemic on the global economy could decrease or delay technology spending and adversely affect demand for our products. Further, our sales and implementation cycles have increased and could continue to increase, which has resulted in and could result in contract terms more favorable to customers and a potentially longer delay between incurring operating expenses and the generation of corresponding revenue, if any, or in difficulty accurately forecasting our financial results. Additionally, our customers may be unable to pay outstanding invoices or may request amended payment terms due to the economic impacts from COVID-19. As a result of these containment measures and the related economic impact to our business, we may be required to record impairment related to our operating lease assets, investments, long-lived assets, or goodwill. We may experience further operational challenges, including increased costs, as a portion of our workforce returns to working in person and gradually shifts to assisting customers in person. Despite the increased availability of vaccines, due to the continuing and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for periods of increases in case numbers and emergence and spread of virus variants in markets and communities in which we, our customers, and our SI partners operate, it is not possible for us to accurately predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse impacts of the pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Further, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.We are in the process of transitioning to a hybrid in-person and remote workforce, which will subject us to certain operational challenges and risks and potential harm to our business.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our workforce shifted from in-person to remote work. We have announced our intention to transition to a hybrid work environment in which a significant portion of our workforce will work either in-person on a part-time basis or remotely on a permanent basis. As a result, we expect to continue to be subject to the challenges and risks of having a remote workforce, as well as new challenges and risks from operating with a hybrid workforce. For example, certain security systems in homes or other remote workplaces may be less secure than those used in our offices, which may subject us to increased security risks, including cybersecurity-related events, and expose us to risks of data or financial loss and associated disruptions to our business operations. Members of our workforce who access company data and systems remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could cause the networks, information systems, applications and other tools available to those remote workers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. We may also be exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. Allowing members of our workforce to work remotely may create intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced Table of Contentsor uncertain intellectual property laws. Further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may be exposed to additional risks without our knowledge. The transition to hybrid in-person as well as remote working may also subject us to other operational challenges and risks. For example, our shift to hybrid working may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel who prefer a fully remote or fully in-person work environment. Operating our business with both remote and in-person workers, or workers who work in flexible locations and on flexible schedules, could have a negative impact on our corporate culture, decrease the ability of our workforce to collaborate and communicate effectively, decrease innovation and productivity, or negatively affect workforce morale. In addition, we expect to incur costs related to the transition to a hybrid workforce to, among other things, facilitate permanent remote work for a portion of our workforce and update our offices to offer more collaborative workspaces. If we are unable to effectively transition to a hybrid workforce, manage the cybersecurity and other risks of remote work, and maintain our corporate culture and workforce morale, our business could be harmed or otherwise negatively impacted.We may experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors.Our quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as investors and research analysts respond to quarterly fluctuations. In addition, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis, particularly on a sequential quarterly basis, may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.Factors that may affect our results of operations include:•the impact of economic downturns and related market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other national and worldwide events on our business and the businesses of our customers, partners and vendors;•our ability to attract new domestic and international customers and renew existing customers;•seasonal buying patterns of our potential customers and our ability to sell additional software and services to existing customers;•the proportion and timing of subscription sales as opposed to term or perpetual software licenses, and the variations in revenue recognition between these contract types;•changes in contract durations of term software licenses and renewals;•increases in costs related to cloud operations, product development, and services;•our ability to develop and achieve market adoption of cloud-based services, including the impact of our customers transitioning from term software licenses to subscription services;•erosion in services margins or significant fluctuations in services revenue caused by changing customer demand, negotiated professional services billing rates, or fixed fee contracts;•our ability to enter into contracts on favorable terms, including terms related to price, payment timing, service levels, acceptance, and product delivery, especially with customers and prospects that possess substantial negotiating leverage and procurement expertise;•the incurrence of penalties for failing to meet certain contractual obligations, including service levels, product development cycles and functionality, and implementation times and objectives;•future accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting rules and our related accounting policies, interpretations, and controls;•our ability to realize expected benefits from our acquisitions and other strategic business transactions;•reductions in our customers’ budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing decisions;•employee retention and the timing of hiring personnel and employee related expenses;•the impact of a recession or any other adverse global economic condition on our business, including pandemics, trade tariffs, trade agreements, and other uncertainties that may cause a delay in entering into or a failure to enter into significant customer agreements or the fulfillment of professional service arrangements;•adverse litigation judgments, dispute-related settlement payments, or litigation-related costs; •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and•the effects of inflation or deflation in the economies in which we operate and its impact on our revenues given the multi-year term of most customer agreements.The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. Further, due to multi-year term licenses and multi-year term license renewals, increased cloud-based subscription services, and other ongoing changes to our business, it is challenging to forecast our quarterly and annual results. Table of ContentsWe believe our ability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a potential revenue shortfall is very limited and our inability to do so could magnify the adverse impact of a potential revenue shortfall on our results of operations. If we fail to achieve our quarterly forecasts, if our forecasts fall below the expectations of investors or research analysts, or if our actual results fail to meet the expectations of investors or research analysts, our stock price may decline.Seasonal sales patterns may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows and may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts, which may cause our stock price to decline.We generally see increased new orders in our fourth fiscal quarter, which is the quarter ended July 31, due to efforts by our sales team to achieve annual incentives. As a result, a significantly higher percentage of our annual license revenue has historically been recognized in our fourth fiscal quarter. Since a substantial majority of our license revenue has annual renewals after the initial term of the contract, we expect to continue to experience this seasonality effect in subsequent years. Generally, accounting under ASC 606 has and may continue to heighten or change the seasonal impact due to license revenue for the entire committed term of our new term licenses and multi-year term license renewals being recognized at the beginning of the agreement. Because of the upfront nature of revenue recognition for new multi-year term licenses and multi-year term license renewals, any quarter in which a significant agreement of this nature is signed, renewed, cancelled or not renewed when scheduled to do so may be impacted. We currently anticipate that sales of, and revenue from, subscription services will continue to increase in the future. Subscriptions are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement after provisioning of the service. Over time, this may reduce the impact of our historic revenue seasonality, but in the near term the introduction of proportionally more subscription services into our revenue stream, together with their delayed and ratable recognition, will likely impact quarter over quarter and year-over-year revenue growth comparisons. Cash flow expectations and comparisons could also be impacted because of the ramped nature of the annual installments of these multi-year subscription services arrangements. Additionally, ARR, which reflects the annualized recurring value of active customer contracts at the end of a reporting period, will be impacted by the seasonality of new sales orders, even if the revenue is recognized ratably.Our quarterly growth in revenue or ARR also may not coincide with new orders or cash flows in a given quarter, which could mask the impact of seasonal variations. This mismatch is primarily due to the following reasons:•our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably and only a portion of the revenue from an order is recognized in the same fiscal period of the order;•subscription arrangements generally have ramped invoicing schedules over the initial term, which affects ARR, but revenue is recognized ratably over the initial term;•our term license agreements and multi-year term license renewals generally have annual billing arrangements even though revenue is recognized upfront for the entire committed term;•as customers enter into a subscription agreement to migrate from an existing term license agreement or as we invest in certain cloud implementations to assist our customers with their migration to our cloud services, the timing of revenue recognition may be impacted by the allocation of revenue between different performance obligations;•we may enter into license agreements with future product delivery requirements, specified terms for product upgrades or functionality, acceptance terms, or unconditional return rights, which may require us to delay revenue recognition for a period of time; and•revenue recognition may not occur in the period when the order is placed due to certain revenue recognition criteria not being met, such as delivery of the software or providing access to the subscription services.Additionally, seasonal patterns may be affected by the timing of particularly large transactions and the large number of renewals that occur in the first fiscal quarter. For example, in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, we achieved higher revenue growth due to a five-year renewal of a single license agreement, which resulted in the first fiscal quarter of 2021 lacking comparability to the prior year and creating a challenging comparable for the first fiscal quarter of 2022.Seasonal and other variations may cause significant fluctuations in our revenues, ARR, results of operations and cash flows, may make it challenging for an investor to predict our performance on a quarterly basis and may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts or meeting or exceeding the expectations of research analysts or investors, which in turn may cause our stock price to decline.If we fail to successfully manage our transition to a business model focused on delivering cloud-based offerings on a subscription basis or fail to meet stipulated service levels with our subscription services, our results of operations could be harmed.Table of ContentsTo address demand trends in the P&C insurance industry, we now offer customers the use of our software products through a cloud-based offering sold on a subscription basis in addition to our self-managed offering. This change to our business model requires a considerable investment of technical, operational, financial, legal, and sales resources. Our software and cloud services involve the storage and transmission of customer data, including in some cases, personal data, and security breaches could result in the loss of this information, which in turn could result in litigation, breach of contract claims, indemnity obligations, harm to our reputation, and other liabilities for us. Our transition to cloud offerings will continue to be the focus of existing resources, require us to hire additional resources, and increase costs, especially in cost of subscription and support revenue and research and development, in any given period. We may not be able to efficiently scale such investments to meet customer demand and expectations, which may impact our long-term growth and results of operations. Further, the increase in some costs associated with our cloud services, such as the cost of third-party infrastructure in which we rely to host our subscription services, may be difficult to predict over time, especially in light of our limited experience with the costs of delivering cloud-based versions of our applications. Furthermore, we may assume greater responsibilities for implementation of subscription services due to our operating and maintaining the cloud environment for our customers. As a result, we may face risks associated with new and complex implementations, the cost of which may differ from original estimates. Our subscription contracts also contain penalty clauses, for matters such as failing to meet stipulated service levels or other contractual provisions, which represent new risks we are not accustomed to managing. Should these penalties be triggered, our results of operations may be adversely affected. These penalties and costs could take the form of monetary credits for current or future service engagements, reduced fees for additional services or products or upon renewal of existing agreements, and a customer’s refusal to pay its contractually-obligated subscription or service fees. Revenue under our cloud-based subscription model will generally be recognized ratably over the term of the contract. The transition to ratable revenue recognition will result in lower revenue we otherwise would have recognized in the initial period of the customer agreement under term license agreements. This effect on recognized revenue may be magnified in any fiscal year due to the concentration of our orders in the fourth fiscal quarter. A combination of increased costs and delayed recognition of revenue would adversely impact our gross and operating margins compared to prior periods. Additionally, the change in our business model and the timing of our customers’ decision to transition from self-managed licenses to cloud-based subscription services could negatively affect our ability to forecast the timing and amount of our revenues in any period.In addition, market acceptance of our cloud-based offerings may be affected by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, price, security, reliability, performance, customer preference, public concerns regarding privacy, and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations. We are in the early stages of re-architecting our existing services and products and developing new services and products in an effort to offer customers greater choices on how they utilize our software. As our business practices in this area develop and evolve over time, we may be required to revise our current subscription agreements, which may result in revised terms and conditions that impact how we recognize revenue and the costs and risks associated with these offerings. Whether our product development efforts or business model transition will prove successful and accomplish our business objectives is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including, but not limited to, customer demand, our ability to further develop, manage, and scale infrastructure, our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements, tax and accounting implications, and our costs. In addition, the metrics we and our investors use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge. It may be difficult, therefore, to accurately determine the impact of this transition on our business on a contemporaneous basis, or to clearly communicate the appropriate metrics to our investors. If we are unable to successfully establish these new cloud offerings and navigate our business model transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, our reputation could suffer and our results of operations could be harmed, which may cause our stock price to decline.We have relied and expect to continue to rely on orders from a relatively small number of customers in the P&C insurance industry for a substantial portion of our revenue and ARR, and the loss of any of these customers would significantly harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our revenue and ARR are dependent on orders from customers in the P&C insurance industry, which may be adversely affected by worldwide economic, environmental, public health, and political conditions. A relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. The composition of our individual top customers has and will vary from year to year. In fiscal year 2019, our ten largest customers accounted for 31% of our revenue, in fiscal year 2020 they accounted for 27%, and in fiscal year 2021 they accounted for 28%. Additionally, our ten largest customers based on ARR accounted for 27% of total ARR at July 31, 2021. Customers for these metrics are calculated at the parent corporation level, while our total customer count is based on entities that have placed orders for our services or products. While we expect this reliance to decrease over time as our revenue, customer base and subscription services as a percentage of revenue grows, we expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, if we fail to successfully sell our services and products to one or more of these anticipated customers in any particular period or fail to identify additional potential customers or such customers purchase fewer of our Table of Contentsservices or products, defer or cancel orders, fail to renew their license or subscription agreements or otherwise terminate or reduce their relationship with us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed. Additionally, if one or more of these anticipated customers enters into or transitions to a subscription agreement in any particular period, or if we fail to achieve the required performance or acceptance criteria for one or more of this relatively small number of customers, our quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly.Failure of any of our established services or products to satisfy customer demands or to maintain market acceptance could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.We derive a significant majority of our revenue and cash flows from our established product offerings, including Guidewire InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud, Guidewire InsuranceNow, Guidewire InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations, and our digital and data services and products. We expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from these sources. As such, continued market acceptance of these services and products is critical to our growth and success. Demand for our services and products is affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the successful implementation of our services and products, the timing of development and release of new products by us and our competitors, the cost and effort to migrate from self-managed products to subscription services, the ease of integrating our software to third-party software and services, technological advances that reduce the appeal of our services and products, changes in the regulations that our customers must comply with in the jurisdictions in which they operate, and the growth or contraction in the worldwide market for technological solutions for the P&C insurance industry. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands, to achieve and maintain a technological advantage over competitors, or to maintain market acceptance of our services, products, our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be adversely affected.We face intense competition in our market, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition and cause our market share to decline.The market for our software and services is intensely competitive. The competitors we face in any sale opportunity may change depending on, among other things, the line of business purchasing the software, the application or service being sold, the geography in which the customer is operating, and the size of the insurance carrier to which we are selling. For example, we are more likely to face competition from small independent firms when addressing the needs of small insurers. These competitors may compete on the basis of price, the time and cost required for implementation, custom development, or unique product features or functions. Outside of the United States, we are more likely to compete against vendors that may differentiate themselves based on local advantages in language, market knowledge, and pre-built content applicable to that jurisdiction. We also compete with vendors of horizontal software products that may be customized to address needs of the P&C insurance industry.Additionally, many of our prospective customers operate firmly entrenched legacy systems, some of which have been in operation for decades. Our implementation cycles may be lengthy, variable, and require the investment of significant time and expense by our customers. These expenses and associated operating risks attendant on any significant process of re-engineering and technology implementation, may cause customers to prefer maintaining legacy systems. Also, maintaining these legacy systems may be so time consuming and costly for our potential customers that they do not have adequate resources to devote to the purchase and implementation of our services and products. We also compete against technology consulting firms that either helped create such legacy systems or may own, in full or in part, subsidiaries that develop software and systems for the P&C insurance industry.As we expand our product portfolio, we may begin to compete with software and service providers we have not competed against previously. Such potential competitors offer data and analytics tools that may, in time, become more competitive with our offerings. We expect the intensity of competition to remain high in the future, as the amount of capital invested in current and potential competitors, including insurtech companies, has increased significantly in recent years. As a result, our competitors or potential competitors may develop improved product or sales capabilities, or even a technology breakthrough that disrupts our market. Continuing intense competition could result in increased pricing pressure, increased sales and marketing expenses, and greater investments in research and development, each of which could negatively impact our profitability. In addition, the failure to increase, or the loss of, market share would harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or future prospects. Our larger current and potential competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their services and products than we can devote to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs, thus leading to their wider market acceptance. We may not be able to compete effectively and competitive pressures may prevent us from acquiring and maintaining the customer base necessary for us to increase our revenue and profitability.Table of ContentsIn addition, the insurance industry is evolving rapidly and we anticipate the market for cloud-based solutions will become increasingly competitive. If our current and potential customers move a greater proportion of their data and computational needs to the cloud, new competitors may emerge that offer services either comparable or better suited than ours to address the demand for such cloud-based solutions, which could reduce demand for our offerings. To compete effectively we will likely be required to increase our investment in research and development, as well as the personnel and third-party services required to improve reliability and lower the cost of delivery of our cloud-based solutions. New competitors are able to develop cloud-based solutions without the cost of maintaining or migrating existing solutions and satisfying existing customer requirements, which may allow them to introduce new services and products more quickly and on more efficient technologies than us. This may increase our costs more than we anticipate and may adversely impact our results of operations. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to further enhance their resources and offerings. Current or potential competitors may be acquired by other vendors or third parties with greater available resources. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might be more able than we are to adapt quickly to new technologies and customer needs, to devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their services and products, to initiate or withstand substantial price competition, or to take advantage of emerging opportunities by developing and expanding their product and service offerings more quickly than we can. Additionally, they may hold larger portfolios of patents and other intellectual property rights as a result of such relationships or acquisitions. If we are unable to compete effectively with these evolving competitors for market share, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Our sales and implementation cycles are lengthy and variable, depend upon factors outside our control, and could cause us to expend significant time and resources prior to generating revenue.The typical sales cycle for our services and products is lengthy and unpredictable, requires pre-purchase evaluation by a significant number of employees in our customers’ organizations, often involves a significant operational decision by our customers, and could be affected by factors outside of our control. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits of our services and products, including the technical capabilities of our services and products and the potential cost savings achievable by organizations deploying our services and products. Customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process, which frequently involves not only our services and products, but also those of our competitors. We spend substantial time, effort, and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce sales, and our customers have significant negotiating power during the sales process which may result in a lengthy sales cycle and significant contractual complexity. Additionally, we may be unable to predict the size and terms of the initial contract until very late in the sales cycle, which affects our ability to accurately forecast revenue and ARR. In addition, we sometimes commit to include specific functions in our base service and product offering at the request of a customer or group of customers and are unable to recognize revenue until the specific functions have been added to our services and products. Providing this additional functionality may be time consuming and may involve factors that are outside of our control. Customers may also insist that we commit to certain time frames in which systems built around our services and products will be operational or that once implemented our services and products will be able to meet certain operational requirements. Our ability to meet such timeframes and requirements may involve factors that are outside of our control, and failure to meet such timeframes and requirements could result in us incurring penalties and costs and/or making additional resource commitments, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. The implementation and testing of our services and products by our customers typically lasts 6 to 24 months or longer and unexpected implementation delays and difficulties can occur. Implementing our services and products typically involves integration with our customers’ and third parties’ systems, as well as adding customer and third-party data to our platform. This process can be complex, time consuming, and expensive for our customers and can result in delays in the implementation and deployment of our services and products. Failing to meet the expectations of our customers during the implementation of our services and products could result in a loss of customers and negative publicity about us and our services and products. Such failure could result from deficiencies in our product capabilities or inadequate service engagements by us, our SI partners, or our customers’ employees, the latter two of which are beyond our direct control. The consequences of such failure could include, and have included, monetary credits for current or future service engagements, reduced fees for additional services or products sales or upon renewals of existing licenses and services, potential reversals of previously recognized revenue, and a customer’s refusal to pay their contractually-obligated license, support, or service fees. In addition, time-consuming and delayed implementations may also increase the amount of services personnel we must allocate to the implementation for it to be successful, thereby increasing our costs and adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Furthermore, our sales and implementation cycles could be interrupted or affected by other factors outside of our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused sales and implementation cycles to lengthen, along with other impacts on our business. We currently have restrictions on travel in place, which are in accordance with recommendations by the U.S. government, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other equivalent agencies in the locations in which we Table of Contentsoperate, and our customers, SI partners, and prospects have likewise enacted their own preventative policies and travel restrictions. Widespread restrictions on travel and in-person meetings have affected and could continue to affect services delivery, delay implementations, and interrupt sales activity. We cannot predict the duration or the extent of adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Revenue mix, as well as declines in our subscription and support gross margin or our services gross margin, could adversely affect our overall gross margin and profitability.Our subscription and support revenue was 34% and 27% of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our subscription and support revenue produces lower gross margins than our license revenue. The gross margin of our subscription and support revenue was 35% and 42% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, while the gross margin for license revenue was 97% and 97% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As our cloud transition continues, we expect that subscription revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue as we contract with new cloud customers and existing customers migrate from term licenses to subscription services. Additionally, we are incurring significant expenses to develop our cloud services and scale our cloud operations which may result in further erosion of our subscription and support gross margin. These trends, along with other factors, some of which may be beyond our control, may adversely affect our overall gross and operating margins. These other factors include the percentage of new customers that enter into subscription services agreements as compared to term license agreements, the revenue impact of allocating total contract consideration between license revenue and subscription and support revenue when existing customers transition from term license to subscription services agreements, investments in certain cloud implementations to assist our customers with their migration to our cloud services, continued growth and efficiency of our cloud operations and technical support teams, and the impact on the global economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other disasters. Further, our services revenue was 25% and 28% of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our services revenue produces lower gross margin than either our license revenue or our subscription and support revenue. The gross margin of our services revenue was negative for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. If we experience an increase in the percentage of total revenue represented by services revenue, like we did in fiscal year 2018 due to acquisitions and other factors, such increase could reduce our overall gross and operating margins. Fluctuation in our services revenue can result from several factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including the pace of our customers’ migration from term license to subscription services as we continue our cloud transition, change in customer demand for our services team’s involvement in the implementation of new services and products, the rates we charge or discounts we offer for our services, our ability to bill our customers for all time incurred to complete a project, the extent and quality of implementations and migrations provided by our SI partners, and the impact on the global economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other disasters. Additionally, the failure to improve, or the erosion of, our services margin, whether due to discounts related to encouraging clients to accelerate their cloud transition or otherwise, particularly in combination with any increase in services revenue, could adversely affect our overall gross and operating margins. Our services margin may erode if we hire and train additional services personnel to support cloud-based services or markets prior to having customer engagements, if we make investments in customer migrations from self-managed term licenses to subscription services, if we enter into fixed fee services arrangements, if our services personnel are underutilized, or if we require additional personnel on unexpectedly difficult projects to ensure customer success, perhaps without receiving commensurate compensation.Our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that result in increased cost of sales, decreased revenue, and lower average selling prices and gross margins, all of which could harm our results of operations.Some of our customers include the world’s largest P&C insurers. These customers have significant bargaining power when negotiating new licenses or subscriptions or renewals of existing agreements, and have the ability to buy similar services and products from other vendors or develop such systems internally. These customers have and may continue to seek advantageous pricing and other commercial and performance terms that may require us to develop additional features in the services and products we sell to them or add complexity to our customer agreements. We have been required to, and may continue to be required to, reduce the average selling price of our services and products in response to these pressures. If we are unable to avoid reducing our average selling prices, our results of operations could be harmed.Table of ContentsOur business depends on customers renewing and expanding their license, support, and subscription contracts for our services and products. A decline in our customer renewals and expansions could harm our future results of operations.Our customers have no obligation to renew their term licenses or subscriptions after their contract period expires, and these licenses and subscriptions, if renewed, may be done so on less favorable terms. Moreover, under certain circumstances, our customers have the right to cancel their licenses or subscriptions before they expire. We may not accurately predict future trends in customer renewals. In addition, our perpetual license customers have no obligation to renew their support arrangements after the expiration of the initial contractual period. Our customers’ renewal rates may fluctuate or decline because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services and products, the prices of our services and products, the prices of services and products offered by our competitors, reductions in our customers’ spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors, or the sale of their operations to a buyer that is not a current customer. Also, in some cases, our customers have a right to exercise a perpetual buyout of their term licenses at the end of the initial contract term, which if exercised would eliminate future term license revenue. If our customers do not renew their term licenses or subscriptions for our solutions or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may decline or grow more slowly than expected and our profitability may be harmed.If we are unable to develop, introduce, and market new and enhanced versions of our services and products, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage.Our success depends on our continued ability to develop, introduce, and market new and enhanced versions of our services and products to meet evolving customer requirements. Because some of our services and products are complex and require rigorous testing, new features, new functionality, and updates to our existing products and services can take significant time and resources to develop and bring to market. As we expand internationally, our services and products must be modified and adapted to comply with regulations and other requirements of the countries in which our customers do business. Additionally, market conditions may dictate that we change the delivery method of our services and products or the technology platform underlying our existing services and products or that new services and products be developed on different technology platforms, potentially adding material time and expense to our development cycles. The nature of these development cycles may cause us to experience delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development and the time we generate revenue, if any, from such expenses.If we fail to develop new services and products, enhance our existing services and products, or migrate our products to the cloud, our business could be adversely affected, especially if our competitors are able to introduce services and products with enhanced functionality in the cloud. It is critical to our success for us to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, and customer requirements and to successfully introduce new, enhanced, and competitive services and products to meet our customers’ and prospective customers’ needs on a timely basis. We have invested and intend to increase investments in research and development and cloud operations to meet these challenges. Revenue may not be sufficient to support the future product development that is required for us to remain competitive. If we fail to develop services and products in a timely manner that are competitive in technology and price or develop services and products that fail to meet customer demands, our market share will decline and our business and results of operations could be harmed. If our research and development efforts do not develop services, products or features that our customers find valuable, then we might incur impairment charges related to our capitalized software development costs.Our ability to sell our services and products is highly dependent on the quality of our professional services and technical support services and the support of our SI partners, and the failure of us or our SI partners to offer high-quality professional services or technical support services could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell our services and products to new customers and renew agreements with our existing customers.If we or our SI partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our services and products, successfully help our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, assist our customers in migrating from self-managed licenses to subscription services, and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to renew existing agreements and sell additional services and products to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Once our services and products are deployed and integrated with our customers’ existing information technology environment, our customers may depend on our technical support services and/or the support of SI partners or internal resources to resolve any issues relating to our services and products. High-quality support is critical for the continued successful marketing and sale of our services and products. In addition, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training, and documentation in languages other than English. Many enterprise customers require higher levels of support than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of our larger customers, it may be more difficult to sell additional services and Table of Contentsproducts to these customers or to transition existing license customers to subscription services, a key strategy for the growth of our revenue and profitability. In addition, as we further expand our cloud-based services and products, our professional services, cloud operations and support organizations will face new challenges, including hiring, training, and integrating a large number of new personnel with experience in delivering high-quality services and support for cloud-based offerings. Further, as we continue to rely on SIs to provide deployment, migration, and on-going services, our ability to ensure a high level of quality in addressing customer issues and providing a maintainable and efficient cloud environment could be diminished as we may be unable to control the quality or timeliness of the implementation of our services and products by our SI partners. Our failure to maintain high-quality implementation and support services, or to ensure that SIs provide the same, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.We may expand through acquisitions or partnerships with other companies, which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating and technology integration difficulties, increased costs, and dilution to our stockholders.Our business strategy includes the potential acquisition of shares or assets of companies with software, cloud-based services, technologies, or businesses complementary to ours. Our strategy also includes alliances with such companies. For example, we have made several acquisitions in the past, including Cyence, a Software-as-a-Service company that applies data science and risk analytics to enable P&C insurers to underwrite “21st century risks” such as terrorism, cybersecurity, and reputational risk, in November 2017. In August 2021, we announced the acquisition of HazardHub, Inc., a leading insurtech provider of API-driven property risk insights. Our prior acquisitions were initially dilutive to earnings, and this recent acquisition is also expected to be dilutive. Acquisitions and alliances may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may not result in the benefits anticipated by such corporate activity. In particular, we may fail to assimilate or integrate the businesses, technologies, services, products, personnel, or operations of the acquired companies, retain key personnel necessary to favorably execute the combined companies’ business plan, or retain existing customers or sell acquired services and products to new customers. Acquisitions and alliances may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business. In addition, we may be required to make additional capital investments or undertake remediation efforts to ensure the success of our acquisitions, which may reduce the benefits of such acquisitions. We also may be required to use a substantial amount of our cash or issue debt or equity securities to complete an acquisition or realize the potential of an alliance, which could deplete our cash reserves and/or dilute our existing stockholders. Following an acquisition or the establishment of an alliance offering new services and products, the timing of revenue from the sale of services and products that we acquired or that result from the alliance, or from the sale of a bundle of services and products that includes such new services and products, may be different than the timing of revenue from existing services and products. In addition, our ability to maintain favorable pricing of new services and products may be challenging if we bundle such services and products with existing services and products. A delay in the recognition of revenue from sales of acquired or alliance services and products, or reduced pricing due to bundled sales, may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results, may adversely affect our operating margins, and may reduce the benefits of such acquisitions or alliances.Additionally, competition within the software industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets has been, and may continue to be, intense. As such, even if we are able to identify an acquisition that we would like to pursue, the target may be acquired by another strategic buyer or financial buyer such as a private equity firm, or we may otherwise not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Moreover, in addition to our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, including our revenue or return on investment assumptions, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities or impairment charges to acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of acquisitions we do complete.If we are unable to continue the successful development of our global direct sales force and the expansion of our relationships with our strategic partners, sales of our services and products will suffer and our growth could be slower than we project.We believe that our future growth will depend on the continued recruiting, retention, and training of our global direct sales force and their ability to obtain new customers, both large and small P&C insurers, and to manage our existing customer base. New hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before becoming productive, if at all. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive global direct sales personnel, sales of our services and products will suffer and our growth will be impeded.Our SI partners help us reach additional customers. We believe our future growth also will depend on the retention and expansion of successful relationships with SI partners, including with SI partners that will focus on services and products we may acquire in the future. Our growth in revenue, particularly in international markets, will be influenced by the development and maintenance of relationships with SI partners, including regional and local SI partners. Although we have established relationships with some of the leading SI partners, our services and products may compete directly against services and Table of Contentsproducts that such leading SI partners support or market. Additionally, we are unable to control the quantity or quality of resources that our SI partners commit to implementing our services and products, the quality or timeliness of such implementations, or the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our SI partners. If our partners do not commit sufficient or qualified resources to these activities, our customers will be less satisfied, be less supportive with references, or may require the investment of our resources at discounted rates. These, and other failures by our partners to successfully implement our services and products, would have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations could fail to grow in line with our projections.Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We sell our services and products to customers located outside the United States, and we are continuing to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy. In fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, $271.1 million, $279.8 million, and $272.9 million of our revenue, respectively, was from customers outside of the United States. Our current international operations and our plans to expand our international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:•increased management, travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations;•unique terms and conditions in contract negotiations imposed by customers in foreign countries;•longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;•the need to localize our contracts and our services and products for international customers;•lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;•increased exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•highly inflationary international economies, such as Argentina;•the burdens and costs of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards, including the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union (“EU”) and the U.K.;•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption regulations, particularly in emerging market countries;•compliance by international staff with accounting practices generally accepted in the United States, including adherence to our accounting policies and internal controls; •import and export license requirements, tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers;•increased financial accounting, tax and reporting burdens and complexities;•weaker protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;•multiple and possibly overlapping tax regimes; •government sanctions that may interfere with our ability to sell into particular countries, such as Russia;•disruption to our operations caused by epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19; and•political, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general.As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.Failure to manage our expanding operations effectively could harm our business.We have experienced consistent growth and expect to continue to expand our operations, including the number of employees and the locations and scope of our international operations. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and related shelter in-place orders have resulted in our employees and contractors working from home, bringing new challenges to managing our business and work force. We have announced our intention to transition to a hybrid work environment in which a large portion of our workforce will work either in-person on a part-time basis or remotely on a permanent basis. This expansion and changing work environment has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our operational and financial resources and our personnel. To manage our anticipated future operational expansion effectively, we must continue to maintain and may need to enhance our information technology and cybersecurity infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls, and manage expanded operations and employees in geographically distributed locations. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new services and products or investments in cloud operations. If we increase the size of our organization without experiencing an increase in sales of our services and products, we will experience reductions in our gross and operating margins and net income. If we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations or hybrid work environment, our expenses may increase more than Table of Contentsexpected, our revenue could decline or grow more slowly than expected, and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.Incorrect or improper use of our services and products or our failure to properly train customers on how to utilize our services and products could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.Our services and products are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of network environments. The proper use of our services and products requires training of the customer. If our services and products are not used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance may result. Our services and products may also be intentionally misused or abused by customers or their employees or third parties who are able to access or use our services and products. Because our customers rely on our services, products, and support to manage a wide range of operations, the incorrect or improper use of our services and products, our failure to properly train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our services and products, or our failure to properly provide services to our customers may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us. Also, any failure by us to properly provide training or other services to existing customers will likely result in lost opportunities for follow-on and increased sales of our services and products.In addition, if there is substantial turnover of customer personnel responsible for the use of our services and products, or if customer personnel are not well trained in the use of our services and products, customers may defer the deployment of our services and products, may deploy them in a more limited manner than originally anticipated, or may not deploy them at all. Further, if there is substantial turnover of the customer personnel responsible for use of our services and products, our ability to renew existing licenses and make additional sales may be substantially limited.We may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, and we may not be able to obtain capital or complete acquisitions through the use of equity without dilution to our stockholders. We may need additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies, including to develop new or enhance existing services and products, acquire businesses and technologies, or otherwise to respond to competitive pressures.If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders could be significantly diluted, and newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we accumulate additional funds through debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities. We cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, when we desire them, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our services and products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. Any of these factors could harm our results of operations.Risks Related to Data Security and Privacy, Intellectual Property, and Information TechnologyTable of ContentsIf our products or cloud-based services experience data security breaches, and there is unauthorized access to our customers’ data, we may lose current or future customers and our reputation and business may be harmed.If our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our cloud services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our services, we may incur significant liabilities and our reputation could be harmed. Our software and cloud services involve the storage and transmission of customer data, including in some cases, personal data, and security breaches could result in the loss of this information, which in turn could result in litigation, breach of contract claims, indemnity obligations, and other liabilities for our company. While we have taken, and are continually updating, steps to protect the confidential information and customer data to which we have access, including confidential information we may obtain through our customer support services or customer usage of our cloud-based services, our security measures or the security measures of companies we rely on, such as AWS, could be breached. We rely on third-party technology and systems for a variety of services, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions, and our ability to control or prevent breaches of any of these systems may be beyond our control. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or infiltrate systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures despite our efforts in implementing and deploying security measures. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers or to increase engagement with existing customers, could cause existing customers to elect not to renew their term licenses or subscription agreements, or could subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations and reputation. Privacy concerns could result in regulatory changes and impose additional costs and liabilities on us, limit our use of information, and adversely affect our business.As adoption of our cloud-based services occurs, the amount of customer data, including customer personal information, that we manage, hold, and/or collect continues to increase. In addition, our services and products may collect, process, store, and use transaction-level data aggregated across insurers using our common data model. We anticipate that over time we will continue to expand the use and collection of personal information as greater amounts of such personal information may be transferred from our customers to us and we recognize that privacy and data security has become a significant issue in the United States, Europe, the U.K., and many other jurisdictions where we operate. Many federal, state, and foreign legislatures and government agencies have imposed, are considering imposing, or are considering changing restrictions and requirements about the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Changes to laws or regulations affecting privacy could impose additional costs and liabilities, including fines, on us and could limit our use of such information to add value for customers, including for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, which takes substantial effect on January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which takes effect on January 1, 2023, the Colorado Privacy Act, which takes effect on July 1, 2023, and the Court of Justice of the EU’s invalidation of the Privacy Shield framework in July 2020. If we were required to change our business activities or revise or eliminate services, or to implement burdensome compliance measures, our business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties, and potential litigation if we fail to comply with applicable privacy and/or data security laws, regulations, standards, and other requirements. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy-related laws, regulations, and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services and products and reduce overall demand.Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy and/or security may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the data and information necessary to allow our customers to use our services and products effectively. Even the perception that the privacy and/or security of personal information is not satisfactorily managed, or does not meet applicable legal, regulatory, and other requirements, could inhibit sales of our services or products, and could limit adoption of our solutions, resulting in a negative impact on our sales, reputation, and results from operations.Privacy concerns in the EU and the U.K. are evolving and we may face fines and other penalties, as well as reputational harm, if we fail to comply with these evolving standards, and compliance with these standards may increase our expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations.On April 27, 2016 the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), that took effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) as well as to those outside the EEA if they carry out processing of personal data of individuals in the EEA that is related to the offering of goods or services to them or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR has enhanced data protection obligations for processors and Table of Contentscontrollers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is to be used, limitations on retention of personal data, enhanced data subject rights, mandatory data breach notification requirements, and onerous new obligations on data processors. Non-compliance with the GDPR can trigger fines of up to €20 million, or 4% of total worldwide annual revenues, whichever is higher. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, complying with GDPR requirements has caused us to expend significant resources and such expenditures are likely to continue into the near future as we respond to new interpretations and enforcement actions and as we continue to negotiate data processing agreements with our customers and business partners. In addition, the GDPR restricts transfers of personal data outside of the EEA to countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections, including the U.S., unless an appropriate safeguard specified by the GDPR is implemented, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) approved by the European Commission and, until July 16, 2020, the Privacy Shield for EU–U.S. data transfers. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, but it deemed that SCCs are valid, provided additional safeguards are in place. However, the ECJ ruled that transfers made pursuant to SCCs and other alternative transfer mechanisms need to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis to ensure EU standards of data protection are met in the jurisdiction where the data importer is based, and there continue to be concerns about whether SCCs will face additional challenges. Moreover, on September 8, 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner announced that it no longer considers the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield to provide adequate protections for transfers of Swiss personal data to the U.S., following the invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield by the ECJ. Further, on June 4, 2021, the European Commission published revised standard contractual clauses for data transfers from the EEA. The revised clauses must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021, while existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. We will be required to implement the revised standard contractual clauses in relation to our customer arrangements within the relevant time frames, which could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. These recent developments will require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and receive personal data transfers to or in the United States. We (and many other companies) may be required to adopt additional measures to accomplish and maintain legitimate means for the transfer and receipt of personal data from the EU to the United States and other countries. As data protection authorities continue to issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.We may experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to use our services due to the potential risk exposure to such customers as a result of such developments and the data protection obligations imposed on them by various data protection authorities. Such customers may also view any alternative approaches to the transfer of any personal data as being too costly, too burdensome, or otherwise objectionable, and therefore may decide not to do business with us.Given our current transition to more cloud-based services and the current data protection landscape in the EU, we may be subject to greater risk of potential inquiries and/or enforcement actions. We may find it necessary to establish alternative systems to maintain EEA personal data within the EEA, which may involve substantial expense and may cause us to need to divert resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may adversely affect our results from operations. Further, any inability to adequately address privacy concerns in connection with our cloud-based services, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, including fines and harm to our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to offer cloud-based services.Starting on January 1, 2021, as a result of Brexit, the U.K. has brought the GDPR into domestic U.K. law with the Data Protection Act 2018 (“U.K. GDPR”), which will remain in force. The U.K. GDPR mirrors the data protection obligations and fines under the GDPR, but there may be further developments about the regulation of particular issues such as U.K. data exports. The transfer of personal data from the United Kingdom to non-adequate countries remains subject to the previous set of standard contractual clauses as approved at the time of Brexit, but the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office (the “ICO”) is currently considering new, U.K.-specific data transfer agreements. The ICO has stated that it is considering whether to recognize the new standard contractual clauses under U.K. law, and therefore our U.K. data export arrangements may also require updating, resulting in further compliance costs. In addition, on June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the United Kingdom, enabling data transfers from EEA member states to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards. However, the U.K. adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the Table of ContentsEuropean Commission re-assesses and renews/extends that decision, and it remains under review by the Commission during this period. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EEA in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how U.K. data protection laws and regulations will develop in the near to long term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. These changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. Anticipated further evolution of EU and U.K. regulations on data privacy and security and any related changes to the regulatory framework in these or other countries may increase substantially our risk exposure to the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. We may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by new regulations and interpretations of existing regulations and we may be required to make significant changes to our software applications and expanding business operations, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations.Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and results of operations.The software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the software industry own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims against us. From time to time, third parties holding such intellectual property rights, including leading companies, competitors, patent holding companies, and/or non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property claims against us, our customers and partners, and those from whom we license technology and intellectual property.Although we believe that our services and products do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties, we cannot assure that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any third-party intellectual property rights or that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future services or products, or that any such assertions will not require us to enter into royalty arrangements, result in costly litigation, or result in us being unable to use certain intellectual property. Infringement assertions from third parties may involve patent holding companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product revenue, and therefore our own issued and pending patents may provide little or no deterrence to these patent owners in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us.If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual property; cease making, licensing, or using our services or products that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our services or products; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or works; and to indemnify our partners, customers, and other third parties. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Real or perceived errors or failures in our services, products including implementation services may affect our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and reduce sales and renewal rates, which may harm our business and results of operations and subject us to liability for breach of warranty claims.Because we offer complex services and products, undetected errors or failures may exist or occur, especially when services and products are first introduced or when new versions or updates are released. Our services and products are often installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our services and products or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our services and products. Despite testing by us, we may not identify all errors, failures, or bugs in new services and products or releases until after commencement of commercial sales or installation. In the past, we have discovered software errors, failures, and bugs in some of our offerings after their introduction. Additionally, our Guidewire Cloud offerings rely on third-party hosting services, primarily Amazon AWS. Any material disruption or slowdown in these services or the systems of third parties who we depend upon could cause outages or delays in our services, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.We provide our customers with upfront estimates regarding the duration, resources, and costs associated with the implementation of our services and products. Failure to meet these upfront estimates and the expectations of our customers could result from our product capabilities or service engagements performed by us, our SI partners, or our customers’ employees, the latter two of which are beyond our direct control. The consequences could include, and have included, monetary Table of Contentscredits for current or future service engagements, reduced fees for additional services or product sales or upon renewals of existing licenses or services, modification of existing contracts that could potentially result in reversals of previously recognized revenue, or a customer’s refusal to pay its contractually-obligated fees. In addition, time-consuming or difficult implementations may also increase the amount of services personnel we must allocate to the implementation project without commensurate compensation, thereby increasing our costs and adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition.The license, subscription, and support of our services and products creates the risk of significant liability claims against us. Our license and subscription agreements with our customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims. It is possible, however, that the limitation of liability provisions contained in such agreements may not be enforced as a result of international, federal, state, and local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions. Breach of warranty or damage liability, or injunctive relief resulting from such claims, could harm our results of operations, and financial condition.Failure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and results of operations.Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent, and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to do so.We have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications related to certain of our innovations. We do not know whether those patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. In addition, we may not receive competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property. Our existing patents and any patents granted to us or that we otherwise acquire in the future, may be contested, circumvented, or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the extent of the protection afforded by these patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, given the costs, effort, risks, and downside of obtaining patent protection, including the requirement to ultimately disclose the invention to the public, we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations; however, such patent protection could later prove to be important to our business.We also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. Nevertheless, competitors may adopt service names similar to ours, or purchase our trademarks and confusingly similar terms as keywords in internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to confusion in the marketplace. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our trademarks. Any claims or customer confusion related to our trademarks could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.We attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by generally requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements, all of which offer only limited protection. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our confidential information, intellectual property, and technology, unauthorized third parties may gain access to our confidential proprietary information, develop and market services or products similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, any of which could materially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and confidential information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Existing United States federal, state, and international intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as governmental agencies and private parties in the United States. Moreover, policing our intellectual property rights is difficult, costly, and may not always be effective.From time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are unable to protect our technology and to adequately maintain and protect our intellectual property rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive Table of Contentsdisadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time, and effort required to create the innovative services and products that have enabled us to be successful to date.We and our customers rely on technology and intellectual property of third parties, the loss of which could limit the functionality of our services and products and disrupt our business.We use technology and intellectual property licensed from unaffiliated third parties in certain of our services and products, and we may license additional third-party technology and intellectual property in the future. Any errors or defects in this third-party technology and intellectual property could result in errors that could harm our brand and business. In addition, licensed technology and intellectual property may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of the right to license and distribute this third-party technology could limit the functionality of our services and products and might require us to redesign our services and products.In addition, our Guidewire Cloud offerings rely on third-party hosting and infrastructure services provided by AWS, for the continuous, reliable, and secure operation of servers, related hardware and software, and network infrastructure. A prolonged AWS service disruption or slowdown for any reason could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. We may be obligated to disclose our proprietary source code to our customers, which may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property and could reduce the renewals of our support services.Our software license agreements typically contain provisions permitting the customer to become a party to, or a beneficiary of, a source code escrow agreement under which we place the proprietary source code for our applicable services and products in escrow with a third party. Under these escrow agreements, the source code to the applicable product may be released to the customer, typically for its use to maintain, modify, and enhance the product, upon the occurrence of specified events, such as our filing for bankruptcy, discontinuance of our support services, and breaching our representations, warranties, or covenants of our agreements with our customers. Additionally, in some cases, customers have the right to request access to our source code upon demand. Some of our customers have obtained the source code for certain of our services and products by exercising this right, and others may do so in the future.Disclosing the content of our source code may limit the intellectual property protection we can obtain or maintain for that source code or the services and products containing that source code and may facilitate intellectual property infringement claims against us. It also could permit a customer to which a product’s source code is disclosed to support and maintain that software product without being required to purchase our support services. Each of these could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Some of our services and technologies may use “open source” software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code of certain services and products subject to those licenses.Some of our services and technologies may incorporate software licensed under so-called “open source” licenses. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. Additionally, some open source licenses require that source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. These open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, become subject to the open source license. If we combine our proprietary software in such ways with open source software, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software.We take steps to ensure that our proprietary software is not combined with, and does not incorporate, open source software in ways that would require our proprietary software to be subject to many of the restrictions in an open source license. However, few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty. Additionally, we rely on hundreds of software programmers to design our proprietary technologies, and although we take steps to prevent our programmers from including objectionable open source software in the technologies and software code that they design, write and modify, we do not exercise complete control over the development efforts of our programmers and we cannot be certain that our programmers have not incorporated such open source software into our proprietary services and products and technologies or that they will not do so in the future. In the event that portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our services and technologies and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.Table of ContentsRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory, Accounting, and Tax MattersThe nature of our business requires the application of accounting guidance that requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Reported results under GAAP may vary from key metrics used to measure our business. Additionally, changes in accounting guidance may cause us to experience greater volatility in our quarterly and annual results. If we are unsuccessful in adapting to and interpreting the requirements of new guidance, or in clearly explaining to stockholders how new guidance affects reporting of our results of operations, our stock price may decline.We prepare our consolidated financial statements to conform to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC, Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting rules and regulations. Accounting standards, such as ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers adopted in fiscal year 2019 or ASC 842 - Leases adopted in fiscal year 2020, or the guidance relating to interpretation and adoption of standards could have a significant effect on our financial results and could affect our business. Additionally, the FASB and the SEC are focused on the integrity of financial reporting, and our accounting policies are subject to scrutiny by regulators and the public. We cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our financial statements going forward. In addition, were we to change our accounting estimates, including those related to the timing of revenue recognition and those used to allocate revenue between various performance obligations, our reported revenue and results of operations could be significantly impacted. For example, the following risks are associated with ASC 606:•investors’ misinterpretation of historic and future trends of our business and what they could mean for the underlying success of our business;•a divergence between revenue and ARR and cash flow trends; and•difficulties in explaining our historical results or new known trends.If we are unsuccessful in adapting to the requirements of the new revenue standard, or if changes to our go-to-market strategy create new risks, then we may experience greater volatility in our quarterly and annual results, which may cause our stock price to decline.In addition, GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Further, revenue recognition standards require significant judgment and estimates that impact our reported revenue and results of operations. Additionally, reported revenue has and will vary from the ARR and cash flow associated with each customer agreement. For example, some arrangements with multiple performance obligations, a portion of recurring license and support or subscription contract value is allocated to services revenue for revenue recognition purposes, but does not get allocated for purposes of calculating ARR. This revenue allocation only impacts the initial term of the contract. This means that as we increase arrangements with multiple performance obligations that include services at discounted rates, more of the total contract value will be recognized as services revenue, but our reported ARR amount will not be impacted. This potential difference and variability in the trends of reported amounts may cause volatility in our stock price.If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner could be adversely affected, investor confidence in our company could diminish, and the value of our common stock may decline.Preparing our consolidated financial statements involves a number of complex manual and automated processes, which are dependent upon individual data input or review and require significant management judgment. One or more of these processes may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) requires, among other things, that as a publicly-traded company we disclose whether our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are effective.Table of ContentsA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.While we continually undertake steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting as our business changes, we may not be successful in making the improvements and changes necessary to be able to identify and remediate control deficiencies or material weaknesses on a timely basis. If we are unable to successfully remediate any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected; our liquidity, access to capital markets and perceptions of our creditworthiness may be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements and debt instruments covenants regarding the timely filing of periodic reports; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting; we may suffer defaults under our debt instruments; and our stock price may decline.If tax laws change or we experience adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns, it could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in, interpretations of, and guidance regarding tax laws, including impacts of the Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”).In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe we have made appropriate provisions for taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the tax laws or challenges from tax authorities under existing tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have received an immaterial proposed assessment from the California Franchise Tax Board for the state income tax returns filed for fiscal years 2018 and 2017. We are currently reviewing this proposed assessment and may appeal. We do not believe the examinations will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in securities class action litigation against us.The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this report, the timing and amount of any share repurchases by us, and other factors beyond our control, such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us and research analyst coverage about our business.Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, have and may continue to affect the market price of our common stock.In the past, we and many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. In July 2020, one of our stockholders filed a putative securities class action complaint in the federal court for the Northern District of California, against us and certain of our current or former officers and directors, alleging misstatements and omissions in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and SEC Rule 10b-5. In October 2020, the suit was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by plaintiff’s counsel. We may become the target of additional complaints of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from our business, which could seriously harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.Table of ContentsWe currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and shares are sold at a profit.Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors. These provisions include:•not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;•authorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;•prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;•limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and•requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is generally necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions that are contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our amended and restated bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 50% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time.These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price of our shares being lower than it would be without these provisions.Our amended and restated bylaws designate certain state or federal courts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claim for: •any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; •any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; •any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or •any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the “Delaware Forum Provision”).Table of ContentsThe Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Further, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the “Federal Forum Provision”), as we are based in the State of California. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.The Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision in our amended and restated bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims. Additionally, these forum selection clauses may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. In addition, while the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are “facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. If the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or it will enhance stockholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our common stock.In October 2020, our board of directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program of up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock, $37.5 million of which remains available for future repurchases as of July 31, 2021. Stock repurchases under the program may be made from time to time, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions and otherwise, at the discretion of management and in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and other applicable legal requirements. Such repurchases may also be made in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 trading plans entered into by us. The timing, pricing, and sizes of these repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock and general market and economic conditions. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in the price of our common stock. The share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock, increase volatility, and diminish our cash reserves.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.As of July 31, 2021, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Convertible Senior Notes”). Our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions, and we and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or recapitalize our debt. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business would increase and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.Pursuant to their terms, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of their Convertible Senior Notes under certain circumstances. Upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be obligated to make cash payments. In addition, holders of our Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2018, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Table of Contentstrustee (the “Trustee”) (the “Base Indenture”), as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2018, between the Company and the Trustee (together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”)) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. Although it is our intention and we currently expect to have the ability to settle the Convertible Senior Notes in cash, there is a risk that we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Senior Notes surrendered therefor or Convertible Senior Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes as required by such Indenture would constitute a default under such Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our Convertible Senior Notes, or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness, and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.In the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of our Convertible Senior Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Senior Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Senior Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Senior Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.Transactions relating to our Convertible Senior Notes may affect the value of our common stock.The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Senior Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our common stock upon any conversion of such Convertible Senior Notes. Our Convertible Senior Notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders under certain circumstances. If holders of our Convertible Senior Notes elect to convert their notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders.In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.From time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Senior Notes. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Senior Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.Table of ContentsUnder FASB Accounting Standards Codification 470-20 (“ASC 470-20”), Debt with Conversion and Other Options, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion option of the Convertible Senior Notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheets as an original issue discount to the Convertible Senior Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the Convertible Senior Notes, net of the discount recorded, will be accreted up to the principal amount of the notes from the issuance date until maturity, which will result in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we will report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s accretion of the debt discount and the instrument’s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes.In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Senior Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. However, recently issued accounting guidance that will be effective for us on August 1, 2022 will no longer permit the use of the treasury stock method. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. Among other things, the guidance eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements, however, we believe the requirement to use the if-converted method instead of the treasury stock method of accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.General RisksOur customers may defer or forego purchases of our services or products in the event of weakened global economic conditions, political transitions, and industry consolidation.General worldwide economic conditions remain unstable, and prolonged economic uncertainties or downturns could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. In particular, pursuant to a decision by referendum in June 2016, the U.K. voted to withdraw from the EU. A trade and cooperation agreement, which addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things, was recently ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU to govern the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the EU as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. Brexit has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Brexit has also caused, and may continue to cause, delays in purchasing decisions by our potential and current customers affected by this transition due to the considerable political and economic uncertainty created by Brexit and uncertainty as to the nature of the U.K.’s long-term relationship with the EU. Brexit may further result in new regulatory and cost challenges to our U.K. and global operations, particularly with respect to data protection. Depending on the market and regulatory effects of Table of ContentsBrexit, it is possible that there may be adverse practical or operational implications on our business, and prolonged economic uncertainties or downturns caused by Brexit could harm our business and results of operations.Further, other global events such as the imposition of various trade tariffs by the United States and China and the COVID-19 pandemic, have created and may continue to create global economic uncertainty, including inflationary pressures, in regions in which we have significant operations. These conditions may make it difficult for our customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and could cause our customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our services and products, which could delay and lengthen our sales cycles or result in cancellations of planned purchases. Moreover, during challenging economic times our customers may face issues in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may not receive amounts owed to us and may be required to record an accounts receivable allowance, which would adversely affect our financial results. A substantial downturn in the P&C insurance industry may cause firms to react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures, reducing their spending on information technology, delaying or canceling information technology projects, or seeking to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. Negative or worsening conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations, could cause a decrease in corporate spending on enterprise software in general, and in the insurance industry specifically, and negatively affect the rate of growth of our business.Furthermore, the increased pace of consolidation in the P&C insurance industry may result in reduced overall spending on our services and products. Acquisitions of customers or potential customers can delay or cancel sales cycles and because we cannot predict the timing or duration of such acquisitions, our results of operations could be materially impacted.If we are unable to retain our personnel and hire and integrate additional skilled personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals and our business will suffer.Our future success depends upon our ability to continue to attract, train, integrate, and retain highly skilled employees, particularly our executive officers, sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel, cloud operations personnel, and software engineers, especially as we transition to a business model focused on delivering cloud-based offerings. Additionally, our stakeholders increasingly expect us to have a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion. Our inability to attract and retain diverse and qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, may seriously harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If U.S. immigration policy related to skilled foreign workers were materially adjusted, such a change could hamper our efforts to hire highly skilled foreign employees, including highly specialized engineers, which would adversely impact our business.Any one of our executive officers and other key employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executive officers, could significantly delay or prevent us from achieving our business and/or development objectives and could disrupt or materially harm our business. Although we strive to reduce the challenges of any transition, failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and a smooth transition could disrupt or adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.We face competition for qualified individuals from numerous software and other technology companies. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, though we also face significant competition in all of our domestic and foreign development centers. Further, significant amounts of time and resources are required to train technical, sales, services, operations, and other personnel. We may incur significant costs to attract, train, and retain such personnel, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment after recruiting and training them.Also, to the extent that we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such personnel have been improperly solicited or have divulged proprietary or other confidential information. In addition, we have a limited number of sales people and the loss of several sales people within a short period of time could have a negative impact on our sales efforts. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational, and managerial requirements, including managing employees and contractors remotely or in a hybrid environment, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so.Further, our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain, and integrate managers with the appropriate skills to lead the local business and employees. Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability Table of Contentsto transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis. If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our reputation could suffer and our ability to attract new clients may be harmed.Because of the technical nature of our services and products and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract, integrate, and retain qualified direct sales, professional services, operations, and product development personnel, as well as our contract workers, could harm our ability to generate sales, deliver consulting services, manage our customers’ cloud environments, or successfully develop new services and products and enhancements of existing services and products.Factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to, natural catastrophes and terrorism may adversely impact the P&C insurance industry, preventing us from expanding or maintaining our existing customer base and increasing our revenue. Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods, and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses.Our customers are P&C insurers that have experienced, and will likely experience in the future, losses from catastrophes or terrorism that may adversely impact their businesses. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, without limitation, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe weather, epidemics, pandemics, and fires. Global warming trends and other environmental factors are contributing to an increase in erratic weather patterns globally and intensifying the impact of certain types of catastrophes. Moreover, acts of terrorism or war could cause disruptions to our business or our customers’ businesses or the economy as a whole. The risks associated with natural catastrophes and terrorism are inherently unpredictable, and it is difficult to forecast the timing of such events or estimate the amount of losses they will generate. Recently, for example, various parts of the United States have suffered extensive damage due to hurricanes, droughts, severe heat and cold events, fires, and other natural disasters, and Australia has experienced extensive damage due to fires. The combined and expected effect of those losses on P&C insurers is significant. Such losses and losses due to future events may adversely impact our current or potential customers, which may prevent us from maintaining or expanding our customer base and increasing our revenue, as such events may cause customers to postpone purchases and professional service engagements or to discontinue existing projects.Our corporate headquarters and the majority of our operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood, epidemic, or pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or collections, or the deployment or availability of our services and products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.Our revenue, results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Argentine Peso, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Danish Kroner, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, New Zealand Dollar, Polish Zloty, Russian Ruble, and Swiss Franc.The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Although we believe our operating activities act as a natural hedge for a substantial portion of our foreign currency exposure at the cash flow or operating income level because we typically collect revenue and incur costs in the currency of the location in which we provide our applications and services, our relationships with our customers are long-term in nature so it is difficult to predict if our operating activities will provide a natural hedge in the future. In addition, because our contracts are characterized by large annual payments, significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that coincide with annual payments may affect our cash flows, revenue or financial results in such quarter. Our results of operations may also be impacted by transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which they are recorded. Moreover, significant and unforeseen changes in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to fail to achieve our stated projections for revenue and operating income, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. We will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which, if material, may harm our revenue or results of operations.Table of ContentsItem 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNot applicable.Item 2.PropertiesOur corporate headquarters in San Mateo, California consists of approximately 189,000 square feet of space leased through December 2029. Our European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland consists of approximately 85,000 square feet of space leased through March 2032. As of July 31, 2021, we also lease facilities for our sales, services, development, operations and administrative activities in various locations in the United States and around the world, including in Bedford, Massachusetts; Birmingham, Alabama; Columbia, South Carolina; Edina, Minnesota; Exton, Pennsylvania; San Diego, California; San Jose, California; Chennai, India; Krakow, Poland; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; London, United Kingdom; Madrid, Spain; Mississauga, Canada; Paris, France; Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo, Japan. We believe that our facilities are suitable to meet our current needs. We are evaluating our real estate strategy as it relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and anticipated needs of a hybrid workforce. In the future, we may expand our facilities or add new facilities as we add employees and enter new geographic markets, and we believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available as needed to accommodate any such growth. We expect to incur additional expenses in connection with such new or expanded facilities.Item 3.Legal Proceedings From time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Any such proceedings, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources or management time.Although the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding in which the outcome, in our judgment based on information currently available, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position.Item 4.Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.Table of ContentsPART II Item 5.Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of EquitySecuritiesOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GWRE”. On July 30, 2021, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $115.20 per share. As of July 31, 2021, we had 38 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.We have never declared or paid, and do not anticipate declaring or paying, any cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.Purchases of Equity Securities by the IssuerThe following table summarizes our repurchase of equity securities during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2021:PeriodTotal Number of Shares PurchasedAverage Price Paid per ShareTotal Number Of Shares Purchased As Part Of Publicly Announced Plans Or Programs(1)Approximate Dollar Value (in millions) of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under The Plans or Programs(1)May 1, 2021 – May 31, 2021126,688$97.081,250,029$63.9June 1, 2021 – June 30, 2021123,950$109.151,373,979$50.4July 1, 2021 – July 31, 2021115,012$112.281,488,991$37.5(1) On October 7, 2020, we announced that our board of directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program of up to $200.0 million of our outstanding stock.

Guidewire’s platform combines core operations, digital engagement, analytics, and AI applications delivered as a cloud service or self-managed software. As a partner to our customers, we continually evolve to enable their success and assist them in navigating a rapidly changing insurance market.Our core operational services and products are InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud, InsuranceNow, and InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations. These services and products are transactional systems of record that support the entire insurance lifecycle, including insurance product definition, distribution, underwriting, policyholder services, and claims management. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is a highly configurable and scalable product, delivered as a service and primarily comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be subscribed to separately or together. These applications are built on and optimized for our Guidewire Cloud Platform (“GWCP”) architecture and leverage our in-house Guidewire Cloud operations team. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is designed to support multiple releases each year to ensure that cloud customers remain on the latest version and gain fast access to our innovation efforts. Additionally, InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud embeds digital and analytics capabilities natively into our platform. Most new sales and implementations are for InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud. InsuranceNow is a complete, cloud-based application that offers policy, billing, and claims management functionality to insurers that have limited internal information technology resources. InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations is comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be licensed separately or together and can be deployed and updated by our customers and their implementation partners. Our digital engagement applications enable digital sales, omni-channel service, and enhanced claims experiences for policyholders, agents, vendor partners, and field personnel. Our Analytics and AI offerings enable insurers to manage data more effectively, gain insights into their business, drive operational efficiencies, and underwrite new and evolving risks. To support P&C insurers globally, we have localized, and will continue to localize, our platform for use in a variety of international regulatory, language, and currency environments.Our customers range from some of the largest global insurance companies or their subsidiaries to predominantly national or local insurers that serve specific states and/or regions. Our customer engagement is led by our direct sales team and supported by our SI partners. We maintain and continue to grow our sales and marketing efforts globally, and maintain regional sales centers throughout the world. Because our platform is critical to our new and existing customers’ businesses, their decision-making and product evaluation process is long, which results in an extended sales cycle. These evaluation periods can extend further if a customer purchases multiple services and products or assesses the benefits of a cloud-based subscription. Sales to new customers also involve extensive customer due diligence and reference checks. Our sales cycle has lengthened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of our sales efforts relies on continued improvements and enhancements to our current services and products, the introduction of new services and products, efficient operation of our cloud infrastructure, continued development of relevant local content and automated tools for updating content, and successful implementations. We sell our cloud-delivered offerings through subscription services and our self-managed products through term licenses. We generally price our services and products based on the amount of DWP that will be managed by our platform. Our subscription, term license, and support fees are typically invoiced annually in advance. Subscription services are generally sold with an initial term of between three and five years with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. Table of ContentsSubscription revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the committed term, once all revenue recognition criteria is met including providing access to the service. Term licenses are primarily sold with an initial two-year committed term with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. We may enter into term license arrangements with our customers that have an initial term of more than two years or may renew license arrangements for longer than one year. A small portion of our revenue is derived from perpetual licenses. Term and perpetual license revenue are typically recognized when software is made available to a customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our support revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed support term of the licensed software. Our support fees are typically priced as a fixed percentage of the associated license fees. We also offer professional services, both directly and through SI partners, to help our customers deploy, migrate, and utilize our platform, services, and products. Substantially all of our services revenue is billed monthly on a time and materials basis.Over the past few years, we have primarily been entering into cloud-based subscription arrangements with our new and existing customers, and we anticipate that subscription arrangements will be a majority of annual new sales going forward. As this sales model matures, we may decide to change certain contract terms in new arrangements to remain competitive or otherwise meet market demands.To extend our technology leadership in the global market and to drive operating efficiency, we continue to invest in product development and cloud operations to enhance and improve our current services and products, introduce new services and products, and advance our ability to cost-effectively deliver our services in the cloud. Continued investment is critical as we seek to assist our customers in achieving their technology goals, maintain our competitive advantage, grow our revenue, expand internationally, and meet evolving customer demands. In certain cases, we may also acquire skills and technologies to manage our cloud infrastructure and accelerate our time to market for new services, products, solutions, and upgrades.Our track record of success with customers and their implementations is central to maintaining our strong competitive position. We rely on our global services team and SI partners to ensure that teams with the right combination of product and language skills are used in the most efficient way to meet our customers’ implementation needs. We have extensive relationships with SI, consulting, technology, and industry partners. Our network of partners has expanded as interest in and adoption of our platform has grown. We encourage our partners to co-market, pursue joint sales initiatives, and drive broader adoption of our technology, helping us grow our business more efficiently and enabling us to focus our resources on continued innovation and further enhancement of our solutions. We work closely with our network of third-party SI partners to facilitate new sales and implementations of both our subscription services and self-managed products. Our partnerships with leading SI partners allow us to increase efficiency and scale while reducing customer implementation costs. We continue to invest time and resources to increase the number of qualified consultants employed by our SI partners, develop relationships with new partners in existing and new markets, and ensure that all SI partners are qualified to assist with implementing our services and products. We believe this model will continue to serve us well, and we intend to continue to expand our network of partners and the number of certified consultants with whom we work so we can leverage our SI partners more effectively, especially for future subscription migrations and implementations.We face a number of risks in the execution of our strategy, including risks related to expanding to new markets, managing lengthy sales cycles, competing effectively in the global market, relying on sales to a relatively small number of large customers, developing new or acquiring existing services and products successfully, migrating our business towards a subscription model with ratable revenue recognition, increasing the overall adoption of our services and products, and cost-effectively managing the infrastructure of our cloud-based customers. In response to these and other risks we might face, we continue to invest in many areas of our business, including product development, cloud operations, implementation services and sales and marketing. COVID-19 ImpactIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which has continued to spread throughout the United States and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, containment measures, and if there are periods of increases in the number of COVID-19 cases or future variants of the virus in areas in which we operate, our compliance with containment measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could continue to disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our key customers, SI partners, vendors, and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, SI partners and communities, a vast majority of our employees are working remotely. In addition, many of our existing and potential Table of Contentscustomers are working remotely, which may continue to delay the timing of new orders and professional services engagements in the future.Our business and financial results since the third fiscal quarter of 2020 have been impacted due to these disruptions, including decreases in ARR growth rates, services revenue and margins, operating cash flow and the change in fair value of strategic investments. ARR and revenue, especially services revenue, continued to be impacted in fiscal year 2021 as a result of the challenges related to our compliance with government-mandated or recommended shelter-in-place orders in jurisdictions in which we, our customers, SI partners and vendors operate. Although vaccines are making progress against the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and certain other parts of the world where vaccinations are widely available, the economic impact of the pandemic on our business and the businesses of our customers, SI partners, and vendors may continue into fiscal year 2022, if not longer. We believe that new sales activities are being delayed, not cancelled, and implementation engagements are being rescheduled to later periods or being completed over a longer period of time. Certain marketing events have or will be cancelled or postponed, while the majority are being hosted virtually, like our customer conference, Connections. Our customers may be unable to pay or may request amended payment terms for their outstanding invoices due to the economic impacts from COVID-19, and we may need to increase our accounts receivable allowances. A decrease in orders in a given period could negatively affect our revenues and ARR in future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis, because a substantial proportion of our new software subscription services orders is recognized as revenue over time. Also, the pandemic’s global economic impact could affect our customers’ DWP, which could ultimately impact our revenue as we generally price our services and products based on the amount of DWP that will be managed by our platform. Additionally, we may be required to record impairment related to our operating lease assets, investments, long-lived assets, or goodwill. In response to the pandemic, various government programs have been announced which provide financial relief to affected businesses. As an example, the Canadian Government enacted the Canada emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”) under their COVID-19 Economic Response Plan to prevent layoffs and help employers offset, for a limited time, a portion of their employee salaries and wages. Beginning in January 2021, we have applied for the CEWS, to the extent we met the requirements to receive a subsidy, and recorded a reduction of compensation expense of approximately $3 million that is reflected in cost of revenue and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2021. We will continue to review and apply for additional subsidies or relief, where applicable. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.Key Business MetricsWe use certain key metrics and financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate and manage our business, including ARR and Free Cash Flow. For a further discussion of how we use key metrics and certain non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”)We use ARR to quantify the annualized recurring value outlined in active customer contracts at the end of a reporting period. ARR includes the annualized recurring value of term licenses, subscription agreements, support contracts, and hosting agreements based on customer contracts, which may not be the same as the timing and amount of revenue recognized. All components of the licensing and other arrangements that are not expected to recur (primarily perpetual licenses and professional services) are excluded. In some arrangements with multiple performance obligations, a portion of recurring license and support or subscription contract value is allocated to services revenue for revenue recognition purposes, but does not get allocated for purposes of calculating ARR. This revenue allocation only impacts the initial term of the contract. This means that as we increase arrangements with multiple performance obligations that include services at discounted rates, more of the total contract value will be recognized as services revenue, but our reported ARR amount will not be impacted. In fiscal year 2021, the recurring license and support or subscription contract value recognized as services revenue was $5.5 million.If a customer contract contains invoicing amounts that increase over the contract term, then ARR reflects the annualized invoicing amount outlined in the contract for the current reporting period. For example, given a contract with annual invoicing of $1.0 million at the beginning of year one, $2.0 million at the beginning of year two, and $3.0 million at the beginning of year three, and the reporting period is subsequent to year two invoicing and prior to year three invoicing, the reported ARR for that contract would be $2.0 million.Table of ContentsAs of July 31, 2021, ARR was $582 million, or $575 million based on currency exchange rates as of July 31, 2020. We measure ARR on a constant currency basis during the fiscal year and revalue ARR at year end to current currency rates. ARR grew in fiscal year 2021 by 13%, or 12% on a constant currency basis.Free Cash FlowWe monitor our free cash flow, as a key measure of our overall business performance, which enables us to analyze our financial performance without the effects of certain non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expenses. Additionally, free cash flow takes into account the impact of changes in deferred revenue, which reflects the receipt of cash payment for services and products before they are recognized as revenue, and unbilled accounts receivable, which reflects revenue that has been recognized that has yet to be invoiced to our customers. Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities is significantly impacted by the timing of invoicing and collections of accounts receivable, the timing and amount of annual bonus payments, as well as payroll and tax payments. Our capital expenditures consist of purchases of property and equipment, primarily computer hardware, software, leasehold improvements, and capitalized software development costs. In the third fiscal quarter of 2020, free cash flow was impacted by a $9.9 million partial early bonus payout, which correspondingly resulted in lower bonus payments in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. This partial early bonus payout was approved by our board of directors in order to support our employees and, in turn, their local economies during the extraordinary situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first fiscal quarter of 2022, we will pay the entire bonus amount for fiscal year 2021 along with accrued vacation for U.S. employees, as we have announced a move to an unlimited vacation policy. The build out and furnishing of our corporate headquarters in San Mateo, California impacted free cash flow by $11.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. The build out and furnishing of our new offices in Mississauga, Canada and Dublin, Ireland impacted free cash flow by a total of $15.6 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. For a further discussion of our operating cash flows, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows.”Fiscal years ended July 31,20212020Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$111,587 $113,066 Purchases of property and equipment(19,008)(21,377)Capitalized software development costs(9,846)(4,283)Free cash flow$82,733 $87,406 Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accounting policies, methods, and estimates are an integral part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and, in part, are based upon management’s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods, and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management’s current judgments. While there are a number of significant accounting policies, methods, and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements, which are described in Note 1 “The Company and a Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenue recognition policies are critical to the periods presented.Revenue RecognitionRevenue recognition requires judgment and the use of estimates, especially in identifying and evaluating the various non-standard terms and conditions in our contracts with customers as to their effect on reported revenue. Our revenue is derived from contracts with customers. The majority of our revenue is derived from subscriptions to our cloud services, licensing arrangements for our software, and implementation and other professional services arrangements. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue upon the transfer of services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. We apply a five-step framework to recognize revenue as described in our Revenue Recognition policy included in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table of ContentsOur customers have significant negotiating power during the sales process, which can and does result in terms and conditions that are different from our standard terms and conditions. When terms and conditions of our customer contracts are not standard, certain negotiated terms may require significant judgment in order to determine the appropriate revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606. The estimates and assumptions requiring significant judgment under our revenue policy in accordance with ASC 606 are as follows:Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contractIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price (“SSP”) in relation to the total fair value of all performance obligations in the arrangement. Some of our performance obligations, such as support, implementation services, and training services, have observable inputs that are used to determine the SSP of those distinct performance obligations. Where SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In the circumstances when available information to determine SSP is highly variable or uncertain, such as for our term licenses, we will use the residual method. The majority of our contracts contain multiple performance obligations, such as when licenses are sold with support, implementation services or training services. As customers enter into a subscription agreement to migrate from an existing term license agreement, customers may be under contract for self-managed licenses and support, in addition to subscription services, for a period of time, which may require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation. Additionally, contract modifications for services and products that are distinct but are not priced commensurate with their SSP or are not distinct from the existing contract may affect the initial transaction price or the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. In such cases, revenue recognized may be adjusted.Changes from Prior Periodic ReportsIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have revised our disclosures to comply with SEC Release No. 33-10825, “Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105.” In addition, we have early adopted the changes in the disclosure standards included in SEC Release No. 33-10890, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information.”Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105The SEC issued Release No. 33-10825, “Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105,” effective for annual periods beginning subsequent to November 2020. This release was adopted to modernize the description of business, legal proceedings, and risk factor disclosures that registrants are required to make pursuant to Regulation S-K. Specifically, this release requires registrants to provide disclosures relating to their human capital resources and to restructure their risk factor disclosures. Additionally, the release increases the threshold for disclosure of environmental proceedings to which the government is a party.Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial InformationThe SEC issued Release No. 33-10890 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information” which became fully effective on August 9, 2021. This release was adopted to modernize, simplify, and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, the SEC eliminated the requirement for selected financial data, only requiring quarterly disclosure when there are retrospective changes affecting comprehensive income, and amending the matters required to be presented under Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) to, among other things, eliminate the requirement of the contractual obligations table. With our adoption of this release, we have eliminated from this document the items discussed above that are no longer required. Information on our contractual obligations is still disclosed in narrative form within the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table of ContentsRecent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 “The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements adopted, including the dates of adoption, which is incorporated herein by reference.Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years presented. The data has been derived from the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K which, in the opinion of our management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations for the fiscal years presented. The operating results for any period should not be considered indicative of results for any future period.

Table of ContentsSubscription and SupportA growing portion of our revenue consists of fees for our subscription services, which are generally priced based on the amount of DWP that is managed by our subscription services. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, beginning at the point in time our provisioning process has been completed and access has been made available to the customer. The initial term of such arrangements is generally from three to five years. Subscription agreements contain optional annual renewals commencing upon the expiration of the initial contract term. A majority of our subscription customers are billed annually in advance. In some arrangements with multiple performance obligations, a portion of recurring subscription contract value may be allocated to license revenue or services revenue for revenue recognition purposes. For example, in arrangements with multiple performance obligations that include services at discounted rates, a portion of the total contract value related to subscription services will be allocated and recognized as services revenue.Our support revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed support term of the licensed software. Our support fees are typically priced as a fixed percentage of the associated term license fees. We generally invoice support annually in advance.LicenseA substantial majority of our license revenue consists of term license fees. Our term license revenue is primarily generated through license fees that are billed annually in advance during the term of the contract, including any renewals. Our term license fees are generally priced based on the amount of DWP that will be managed by our licensed software. Our term licenses have generally been sold under a two-year initial term with optional annual renewals after the initial term. However, we do enter into license arrangements that have an initial term of more than two years and renewal terms of more than one year. Term license revenue for the committed term of the customer agreement is generally fully recognized upon delivery of the software or at the beginning of the renewal term.In a limited number of cases, we license our software on a perpetual basis. Perpetual license revenue is generally recognized upon delivery. We invoice our perpetual license customers either in full at contract signing or on an installment basis.ServicesOur services revenue is primarily derived from implementation services performed for our customers, reimbursable travel expenses, and training fees. A substantial majority of our services engagements are billed and recognized on a time and materials basis upon providing our services. Fiscal years ended July 31, 20212020 Change % of total % of total AmountrevenueAmountrevenue($)(%) (in thousands, except percentages)Revenue:Subscription and support:Subscription$168,649 23 %$119,658 16 %$48,991 41 %Support83,709 11 83,815 11 (106)— License:Term license303,309 41 328,489 44 (25,180)(8)Perpetual license483 — 3,065 1 (2,582)(84)Services187,117 25 207,280 28 (20,163)(10)Total revenue$743,267 100 %$742,307 100 %$960 — %Subscription and Support We anticipate subscriptions will continue to represent a majority of new arrangements, including customers migrating from existing term license arrangements to subscription services, in future periods. Due to the ratable recognition of subscription revenue, growth in subscription revenue will lag behind the growth of subscription orders and will impact the comparative growth of our reported revenue. If we complete a higher percentage of subscription arrangements in a given period, our short-term growth rates will be negatively impacted. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, the impact of new subscription orders in the fourth fiscal quarter, our historically largest quarter for new orders, is not reflected in revenues until the following fiscal year.Table of ContentsSubscription revenue increased by $49.0 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of new subscription services agreements for InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud entered into and provisioned since July 31, 2020.License support revenue was flat, compared to the prior year. Support related to subscription arrangements is included in subscription revenue, as support is not quoted or priced separately from the subscription services. As customers enter into a subscription agreement to migrate from an existing term license agreement, the timing and amount of revenue recognized will be impacted by allocations of the total contract value between the license, subscription, and support performance obligations. As a result, we expect the increase in subscription orders as a percentage of total new sales and customers migrating from term licenses to subscription services will continue to reduce the growth in, or result in lower, support revenue in the future. LicenseRevenue related to new term licenses and multi-year term license renewals is generally recognized upfront and, as a result, no additional license revenue is recognized until after the committed term expires. As a customer enters into a subscription agreement to migrate from an existing term license agreement, the timing and amount of revenue recognition will be impacted by allocations of total contract value between license, subscription, and support performance obligations. License revenue growth has and will be negatively impacted as subscription sales increase as a percentage of total new sales and as customers migrate from term licenses to subscription services instead of renewing their term licenses.Term license revenue decreased by $25.2 million, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenue from new term licenses of $12.4 million and term license renewals of $12.3 million. Included in these amounts is the impact of term license contracts with an initial term of greater than two years or a renewal term of greater than one year. The impact on term license revenue from contracts that deviated from our standard contract durations was $23.4 million in fiscal year 2021 compared with $37.6 million in the prior year.Perpetual license revenue decreased by $2.6 million, compared to the prior year, and accounted for less than 1% of total revenue in fiscal year 2021. We expect perpetual license revenue to continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenue. Perpetual license revenue may potentially be volatile across periods due to the large amount of perpetual revenue that may be generated from a single customer order.Services RevenueServices revenue decreased $20.2 million, compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by contracts with lower average services billing rates and increased investments in customer implementations to accelerate their transition to the cloud, and to a lesser extent a $6.8 million reduction in revenue from billable travel costs due to travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during fiscal year 2021. We expect modestly higher levels of variability in our services revenue in future periods. As we successfully leverage our SI partners to lead more implementations, our services revenue could decrease further. We expect challenges related to COVID-19 will also continue to negatively impact services revenue. As we continue to expand into new markets and develop new services and products, we have, and may continue to, enter into contracts with lower average billing rates, make investments in customer implementation and migration engagements, and enter into fixed price contracts, which may impact services revenue and services margins.Cost of Revenue and Gross ProfitOur cost of subscription and support revenue consists of personnel costs for our cloud operations and technical support teams, cloud infrastructure costs, development of online training curriculum, amortization of our intangible assets, and royalty fees paid to third parties. Our cost of license revenue primarily consists of development of online training curriculum, royalty fees paid to third parties, and amortization of our intangible assets. Our cost of services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our professional service employees, third-party contractors, and travel-related costs. In instances where we have primary responsibility for the delivery of services, subcontractor fees are expensed as cost of services revenue. In each case, personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.We allocate overhead such as information technology support, information security, facilities, and other administrative costs to all functional departments based on headcount. As such, these general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each functional operating expense.

The increase in personnel costs is net of a $1.6 million benefit related to CEWS received in fiscal year 2021.Due to our growth in cloud operations, new cloud-based customers, and increased usage from existing cloud-based customers, the costs to provide our subscription services increased. We expect our cost of subscription revenue to increase as we continue to invest in our cloud operations and incur higher cloud infrastructure costs to support our growing cloud customer base, to improve efficiencies, and to continuously improve and maintain secure environments. However, we believe that the cost of subscription revenue will grow at a slower rate than subscription revenue in future years as we achieve economies of scale and other efficiencies. Cost of support revenue is expected to remain flat or slightly decrease over time as term license customers transition to the cloud. The short-term impact of these trends along with mix within subscription and support revenue may result in a decline in subscription and support gross margin even though subscription and support gross profit increases in absolute dollars.The $1.0 million decrease in our cost of license revenue was primarily attributable to decreases in amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.3 million, partially offset by costs associated with the development of online training curriculum included with the latest releases of InsuranceSuite. We continue to anticipate lower cost of license revenue over time as our term license customers transition to cloud subscription agreements.The $9.8 million decrease in cost of services revenue was primarily attributable to decreases of $8.2 million in billable subcontractor expenses, $7.4 million in employee and third party consultant travel-related costs resulting from COVID-19 travel restrictions, and $1.0 million in professional services, general office and software costs, partially offset by an increase of $6.9 million in personnel-related costs mainly due to higher bonus attainment based on company performance. The increase in personnel-related costs is net of a $0.4 million benefit related to the CEWS received in fiscal year 2021.We had 600 cloud operations and technical support employees and 657 professional service employees at July 31, 2021 compared to 378 cloud operations and technical support employees and 758 professional services employees at July 31, 2020. In fiscal year 2020, certain professional services employees supported our cloud operations and research and development activities, and the related personnel costs were reflected within cost of subscription revenue and research and development expense. Since July 31, 2020, approximately 115 employees have been transferred from professional services to cloud operations and research and development to support the growth in our cloud customers.Table of ContentsGross Profit Fiscal years ended July 31, 20212020Change Amountmargin %Amountmargin %($)(%) (In thousands, except percentages)Gross profit: Subscription and support$87,375 35 %$86,315 42 %$1,060 1 %License293,223 97 319,988 97 (26,765)(8)Services(12,385)(7)(2,011)(1)(10,374)516 Total gross profit$368,213 50 %$404,292 54 %$(36,079)(9)%Our gross profit decreased $36.1 million compared to the prior year. Gross profit was impacted by the decrease in term license revenue due to lower impact of multi-year term license arrangements entered into in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 and decreases in professional services revenue driven by contracts with lower average services billing rates and increased investment in implementation engagements.Our gross margin decreased to 50% in fiscal year 2021, as compared to 54% in fiscal year 2020. Gross margin was impacted by lower subscription and support gross margins resulting from increasing investments in cloud operations and lower services gross margin resulting from contracts with lower average services billing rates and investments in implementation engagements.We expect subscription and support gross margins will fluctuate as our subscription revenue increases and we continue to invest in our cloud operations. However, as we gain efficiencies and increase the number of cloud customers, we expect subscription gross margins to improve over time. In addition to the impact of our investment in customer migrations and implementations, challenges related to COVID-19 may negatively impact services gross margin beyond this fiscal year. We expect license gross margin will fluctuate based on changes in revenue due to the timing of delivery of new multi-year term licenses and the execution of multi-year term license renewals, as cost of license revenue is expected to be relatively consistent with prior years in the future. Overall, we expect gross margins to decline in the short-term primarily due to the mix between license revenue and subscription and support revenue. Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The largest components of our operating expenses are personnel costs for our employees and, to a lesser extent, professional services. In each case, personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation. We allocate overhead such as information technology support, information security, facilities, and other administrative costs to all functional departments based on headcount. As a result, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each functional operating expense.

The $18.9 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increases of $17.6 million in personnel costs associated with higher headcount and bonus attainment that is based on company performance in fiscal year 2021, $2.6 million of cloud infrastructure costs for our development environments, and $0.8 million in professional services costs for consultants that support the development of our subscription offerings, information security requirements and cloud strategy. The increase in personnel costs is net of a $1.2 million benefit related to the CEWS received in fiscal 2021. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel costs of $2.1 million due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Our research and development headcount was 853 as of July 31, 2021 compared with 809 as of July 31, 2020.We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire and dedicate internal resources to develop, improve, and expand the functionality of our solutions and migrating our solutions to the cloud. Research and development expenses may also increase if we pursue additional acquisitions.Sales and MarketingOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees. Included in our personnel costs are commissions, which are considered contract acquisition costs and are capitalized when earned and expensed over the anticipated period of time that goods and services are expected to be provided to a customer, which we estimate is to be approximately five years. Sales and marketing expenses also includes travel expenses, professional services for marketing activities, and amortization of certain acquired intangibles. The $18.1 million increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases of $23.0 million in personnel costs due to higher headcount to sell and market our services and products, including an increase of $3.5 million related to the net effect of the capitalization and amortization of contract acquisition costs (primarily commissions), and $1.0 million in professional services costs to assist in the development of business strategies and customer success alliances. The increase in personnel costs is net of a $0.2 million benefit related to the CEWS received in fiscal year 2021. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $5.3 million in travel costs due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, $0.7 million in marketing and advertising costs mainly due to the hosting of Connections Reimagined as a series of virtual events in fiscal year 2021 compared to an in-person event in fiscal year 2020, and $0.7 million due to lower amortization of acquired intangible assets. Table of ContentsOur sales and marketing headcount was 426 as of July 31, 2021 compared with 399 as of July 31, 2020. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities to support our business growth and objectives. Additionally, we anticipate that Connections will be an in-person event in the future, supplemented by virtual content, which may contribute to an increase in sales and marketing expenses.General and AdministrativeOur general and administrative expenses include executive, finance, human resources, legal, and corporate development and strategy functions, and primarily consist of personnel costs, as well as professional services.The $8.6 million increase in our general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases of $7.0 million in personnel-related costs due to higher headcount and bonus attainment that is based on company performance and $1.3 million increase in software and professional services costs to support our growth and remote environment.Our general and administrative headcount was 406 as of July 31, 2021 compared with 346 as of July 31, 2020. General and administrative headcount includes personnel in information technology support, information security, facilities, and recruiting whose costs are allocated across all functional departments.We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in personnel, corporate infrastructure, and systems required to support our strategic initiatives, the growth of our business, and our compliance and reporting obligations.Other Income (Expense) Fiscal years ended July 31, 20212020Change AmountAmount($)(%) (In thousands, except percentages)Interest income$7,395 $24,705 $(17,310)(70)%Interest expense$(18,711)$(17,945)$(766)4 %Other income (expense), net$12,619 $(7,205)$19,824 275 %Interest IncomeInterest income represents interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Interest income decreased by $17.3 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to lower yields on invested funds and, to a lesser extent, lower funds available for investment due to our share repurchase program.Interest ExpenseInterest expense includes both stated interest and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with the $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes. The amortization of debt discount and issuance costs are recognized on an effective interest basis. Stated interest expense is consistent in the comparative periods as the outstanding principal and stated interest rate have not changed.Interest expense for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 consist of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $13.6 million and $12.9 million, respectively, and stated interest of $5.0 million in both periods. Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net includes foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on monetary asset and monetary liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which they are recorded. Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies in other than the functional currency of the entity in which they are recorded consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables. We currently have entities with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Danish Kroner, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, New Zealand Dollar, Polish Zloty, Russian Ruble, and Swiss Franc.Other income (expense), net in fiscal year 2021 was income of $12.6 million, compared to expense of $7.2 million in fiscal year 2020, which included a $10.7 million reduction in fair value of one of our strategic investments. Excluding the effect of the reduction in strategic investment fair value, other income increased $9.1 million primarily due to gains from exchange rate movements on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which they were recorded.Table of ContentsProvision for (benefit from) Income TaxesWe are subject to taxes in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions and countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current U.S. income tax.

The increase in our income tax benefit for fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax net loss, the release of a reserve for an uncertain tax position, and the impact related to the tax status change of certain foreign subsidiaries for U.S. tax purposes, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. As of July 31, 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $10.9 million that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate as certain unrecognized tax benefits have a valuation allowance.The effective tax rate of 36% for fiscal year 2021 differs from the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21% mainly due to permanent differences for stock-based compensation, including excess tax benefits, the release of a reserve for an uncertain tax position, research and development credits, the tax status change of certain foreign subsidiaries, change in valuation allowance, and certain non-deductible expenses including executive compensation.Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, filed on September 28, 2020, for the discussion of the comparison of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented in the consolidated financial statements.Table of ContentsQuarterly Results of OperationsOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, making our results of operations variable and difficult to predict. Such factors include those discussed above and those set forth in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We may experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Seasonal sales patterns may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows and may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts, which may cause our stock price to decline” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. One or more of these factors may cause our results of operations to vary widely. As such, we believe that our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future and that sequential quarterly comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to the key business metrics presented above, we believe that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other software companies because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, our management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included herein and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.The following table reconciles the specific items excluded from GAAP in the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated below:Fiscal years ended July 31,20212020Gross profit reconciliation:GAAP gross profit$368,213 $404,292 Non-GAAP adjustments:Stock-based compensation33,810 29,160 Amortization of intangibles13,175 19,221 COVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)(1,975)— Non-GAAP gross profit$413,223 $452,673 Income (loss) from operations reconciliation:GAAP income (loss) from operations$(105,584)$(23,886)Non-GAAP adjustments:Stock-based compensation115,009 101,817 Amortization of intangibles19,965 26,834 COVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)(3,396)— Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations$25,994 $104,765 Net income (loss) reconciliation:GAAP net income (loss)$(66,507)$(27,198)Non-GAAP adjustments:Stock-based compensation115,009 101,817 Amortization of intangibles19,965 26,834 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs13,617 12,886 Changes in fair value of strategic investment(2)— 10,672 COVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)(3,396)— Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments(3)(37,379)(19,243)Non-GAAP net income (loss)$41,309 $105,768 Tax provision (benefit) reconciliation: GAAP tax provision (benefit)$(37,774)$2,867 Non-GAAP adjustments:Stock-based compensation(20,979)16,453 Table of ContentsAmortization of intangibles(4,220)4,334 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs(2,555)2,080 Changes in fair value of strategic investment(2)— 1,418 COVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)(135)— Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments(3)65,268 (5,042)Non-GAAP tax provision (benefit)$(395)$22,110 Net income (loss) per share reconciliation: GAAP net income (loss) per share – diluted$(0.79)$(0.33)Non-GAAP adjustments:Stock-based compensation1.39 1.23 Amortization of intangibles0.25 0.33 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs0.16 0.16 Changes in fair value of strategic investment(2)— 0.13 COVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)(0.04)— Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments(3)(0.45)(0.23)Non-GAAP dilutive shares excluded from GAAP net income (loss) per share calculation(4)(0.03)(0.03)Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share – diluted $0.49 $1.26 Shares used in computing Non-GAAP income (loss) per share amounts: GAAP weighted average shares – diluted83,577,375 82,855,392 Non-GAAP dilutive shares excluded from GAAP income (loss) per share calculation(4)805,747 834,002 Pro forma weighted average shares – diluted84,383,122 83,689,394 (1) Effective the second fiscal quarter of 2021, the COVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit was included as a non-GAAP adjustment. Prior to the second fiscal quarter of 2021, this program was not available.(2) Effective the third fiscal quarter of 2020, changes in fair value of strategic investments are excluded from non-GAAP measures. Prior to the third fiscal quarter of 2020, there were no changes in fair value of strategic investments in any periods presented.(3) Adjustments reflect the impact on the tax benefit (provision) resulting from all non-GAAP adjustments. (4) Due to the occurrence of a net loss on a GAAP basis, potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of GAAP net income (loss) per share, as they would have an anti-dilutive effect. However, these shares have a dilutive effect on non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and, therefore, are included in the non-GAAP net income (loss) per share calculation.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are as follows (in thousands):July 31, 2021July 31, 2020Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$1,346,591 $1,434,267 Working capital$1,054,971 $1,118,020 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and InvestmentsOur cash equivalents are comprised of liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase, primarily commercial paper and money market funds. Our investments primarily consist of corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, commercial paper, asset-backed securities, and non-U.S. government securities, which include state, municipal and foreign government securities. As of July 31, 2021, approximately $58.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions. While we have no current plans to repatriate these funds to the United States, we may repatriate foreign earnings in the future to the extent that the repatriation is not restricted by local laws or there are no substantial incremental costs associated with such repatriation.Share Repurchase ProgramIn October 2020, our board of directors authorized and approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we repurchased 1,488,991 shares of common stock Table of Contentsat an average price of $109.17 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $162.5 million. As of July 31, 2021, $37.5 million remained available for future share repurchases.Cash FlowsOur cash flows from operations are significantly impacted by timing of invoicing and collections of accounts receivable, annual bonus payments, as well as payments of payroll, commissions, payroll taxes, and other taxes. We expect that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations on an annual basis, although this may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. In particular, we typically use more cash during the first fiscal quarter ended October 31, as we generally pay cash bonuses to our employees for the prior fiscal year during that period and seasonally higher sales commissions from increased customer orders booked in our fourth fiscal quarter of the prior year. Additionally, our capital expenditures may fluctuate depending on future office build outs and development activities subject to capitalization. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts, investments in cloud infrastructure and operating costs, and expansion into other markets. We also may invest in or acquire complementary businesses, applications or technologies, or may expand our board-authorized stock repurchase program, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing.The following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (in thousands): Fiscal years ended July 31, 20212020Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$111,587 $113,066 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$64,191 $(5,801)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(159,387)$4,955 Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.5 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The decrease in operating cash was primarily attributable to a $55.7 million increase in net loss after excluding the impact of non-cash charges such as deferred taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, change in fair value of our strategic investments, and other non-cash items, partially offset by a $54.2 million increase in cash provided by working capital activity as compared to the prior year.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesNet cash provided by investing activities increased by $70.0 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase of $73.4 million in net cash flows from marketable securities transactions and lower office build out costs of $2.4 million after completing the build out and furnishing of our corporate headquarters in San Mateo, California in fiscal year 2020, offset by a $5.6 million increase in capitalized cloud software development costs and a $0.2 million increase related to strategic investments.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased by $164.3 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was due to $161.3 million of repurchased common stock under our share repurchase program and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in proceeds from option exercises of $3.0 millionContractual ObligationsOur estimated future obligations consist of leases, royalties, purchase obligations, debt, and unrecognized tax benefits as of July 31, 2021. Refer to Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 10 “Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough July 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of July 31, 2021, and 2020. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of July 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1,346.6 million and $1,434.3 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of cash, money market funds, corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, commercial paper, asset-backed securities and non-U.S. government securities, which include state, municipal, and foreign government securities. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $5.2 million and $5.6 million in the market value of our available-for-sale securities as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Argentine Peso, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Danish Kroner, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, New Zealand Dollar, Polish Zloty, Russian Ruble, and Swiss Franc, the currency of the locations within which we currently operate. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We believe our operating activities act as a natural hedge for a substantial portion of our foreign currency exposure because we typically collect revenue and incur costs in the currency of the location in which we provide our services. However, our relationships with our customers are long-term in nature so it is difficult to predict if our operating activities will provide a natural hedge in the future. Additionally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our financial results due to transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain monetary asset and monetary liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which they are recorded. Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which they are recorded consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables. The movement in foreign currency exchange rates has resulted in a $9.0 million increase in other income (expense), net. We will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If a hypothetical ten percent change in foreign exchange rates were to occur in the future, the resulting transaction gain or loss would be approximately $18.9 million. As our international operations grow, we will continue to assess our approach to managing our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWe do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments in financial instruments, as our investments primarily consist of highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three years or less. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. However, this current position does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future.Our strategic investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity and convertible debt that may have different rights and preferences. The particular securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movements in the total enterprise value of the company in which we are invested. As a result, our investment in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company. In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, or other favorable Table of Contentsmarket event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our investment. All of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.Table of ContentsItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplemental DataGUIDEWIRE SOFTWARE, INC.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Evaluation of revenue related to software licensing arrangements and subscriptions to cloud services with non-standard terms As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue was derived principally from software licensing arrangements, subscriptions to cloud services, and implementation and other professional services. The Company recognized total revenue of $743.3 million for the year ended July 31, 2021. The Company’s software licensing arrangements generally have a two-year initial term and subscriptions to cloud services generally have a three-to five-year term, with a customer option to renew on an annual basis after the initial term. Consideration for software licensing arrangements and subscriptions to cloud services is typically billed in advance on an annual basis over the term. We identified the evaluation of revenue from software licensing arrangements and subscriptions to cloud services with non-standard terms and conditions as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s assessment of the impact on revenue recognition of non-standard terms and conditions, specifically, the identification and evaluation of the accounting impact of contract modifications related to software licensing term extensions, and arrangements that provide a customer with the ability to transition from a software licensing arrangement to a subscription to cloud services during the contractual term. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the identification and evaluation of software licensing arrangements and subscriptions to cloud services with non-standard terms and conditions. We tested certain software licensing arrangements and subscriptions to cloud services by reading the underlying customer agreements and evaluating the Company’s assessment of the contractual terms and conditions in accordance with revenue recognition requirements. Specifically, this included an evaluation of the Company’s identification and assessment of non-standard terms and conditions that could give rise to special accounting consideration. /s/ KPMG LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2006.Santa Clara, CaliforniaSeptember 24, 2021Table of ContentsGUIDEWIRE SOFTWARE, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and EstimatesCompanyGuidewire Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on September 20, 2001. Guidewire Software, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”), provides a technology platform which combines core operations, digital engagement, analytics, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) applications. The Company’s technology platform supports core insurance operations, including underwriting and policy administration, claim management and billing; insights into data that can improve business decision making; and digital sales, service and claims experiences for policyholders, agents, and other key stakeholders. The Company’s customers are primarily property and casualty insurance carriers.Basis of Presentation and ConsolidationThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements and notes include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and reflect all adjustments (all of which are normal and recurring in nature) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.ReclassificationBeginning with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020, the Company changed the presentation in the consolidated statements of operations for revenue and cost of revenue to include subtotals for “subscription and support,” “license,” and “services.” The Company's previous presentation included subtotals for “license and subscription,” “maintenance” (now referred to as “support”), and “services”. Accordingly, fiscal year 2019 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Additionally, certain prior period amounts within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, accounts receivable allowances, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, annual bonus attainment, income tax uncertainties, fair value of convertible senior notes and investments, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, software development costs to be capitalized, leases, and contingencies. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.Foreign Currency The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. The Company translates all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate as of the applicable balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period in which the transactions occur. The effects of foreign currency translations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the recording entity are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents primarily consist of commercial paper and money market funds. Table of ContentsInvestments Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase based upon management’s intent with regard to such investments. All investments in the periods presented have been classified as available-for-sale.The Company classifies investments as short-term when they have remaining contractual maturities of one year or less from the balance sheet date, and as long-term when the investments have remaining contractual maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. Investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses, net of taxes, generally included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized losses related to the credit worthiness of an investment, if any, are recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the life or improve an asset are expensed in the period incurred.The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:Computer hardware3 yearsPurchased software3 yearsEquipment and machinery3 to 5 yearsFurniture and fixtures5 yearsLeasehold improvementsShorter of 10 years or remaining lease termSoftware Development CostsCertain development costs related to software delivered to customers (“self-managed software”) incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are subject to capitalization and amortized over the estimated lives of the related services or products. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been material and, therefore, all software development costs related to self-managed software have been charged to research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as incurred.The Company capitalizes software development costs for technology applications that the Company will offer solely as cloud-based subscriptions, which is primarily comprised of compensation for employees who are directly associated with cloud software development projects. The Company begins to capitalize costs when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. If any of these criteria cease being met before the software reaches its intended use, any capitalized costs related to the project will be impaired. When the software reaches its intended use which is typically once the technology applications are available for general release, capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally estimated to be three to five years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these capitalization criteria and costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Capitalized software development costs are recorded in property and equipment in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.LeasesOn August 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842: Leases (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective transition approach by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Under ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the agreement. If an arrangement is determined to be a lease, an operating lease asset, also known as a right-of-use asset, and lease liability are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In connection with determining the present value of the lease payments, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement, including non-lease components that are fixed throughout the lease term. Variable components of the lease payments such as utilities and maintenance costs, are expensed as incurred and not included in determining the present value of the lease liability. As the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company's incremental borrowing rate, calculated based on available information at the lease commencement date, is used in determining the present value of the lease payments. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on the Company's understanding of its credit rating. The Company's lease term used to calculate the lease liability and operating lease asset Table of Contentsincludes options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease assets also include any lease payments made prior to commencement and are recorded net of any lease incentives received. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in each of the cost of revenue and operating expense categories.The Company also enters into agreements to sublease unoccupied office space. Any sublease payments received in excess of the straight-line rent expense related to the subleased space are recorded as an offset to operating expenses over the sublease term.Operating leases are included in operating lease assets, other current liabilities, and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, and GoodwillThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets, consisting of property and equipment, operating lease assets, and intangible assets, for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of certain assets may not be recoverable. Impairment exists if the carrying amount of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Should impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying amount of the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets.The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and in the interim whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers events and circumstances, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy, changes in customers, changes in the composition or carrying amount of a reporting unit’s net assets, and changes in the price of the Company’s common stock. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test is not performed. There have been no goodwill impairments during the periods presented.Convertible Senior NotesIn March 2018, the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Convertible Senior Notes”). The Company accounts for the liability and equity components of the issued Convertible Senior Notes separately. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Senior Notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The liability and equity components will not be remeasured as long as the conversion option continues to meet the requirements for equity classification. The equity component is net of issuance costs and recorded in additional paid-in capital.Business CombinationsThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these assets and liabilities, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, subsequent adjustments, if any, are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, and unbilled accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash, cash equivalents, and investments with high quality financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk for cash held in Table of Contentsfinancial institutions in the event of a default to the extent that such amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are in excess of amounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. No customer individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenue for the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. As of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total accounts receivable.Accounts Receivable and Allowances Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. While the Company does not require collateral, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses based upon the expected collectability of its accounts receivable. The expectation of collectability is based on historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. Credit losses are recorded in general and administrative expense while billing and other revenue adjustments are recorded against the corresponding revenue financial statement line item in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenue RecognitionThe Company’s revenue is derived from contracts with customers. The majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from subscriptions to its cloud services, licensing arrangements for its software, and implementation and other professional services arrangements. The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue upon the transfer of services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. The Company applies the following framework to recognize revenue:Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customerThe Company considers the terms and conditions of written contracts and its customary business practices in identifying its contracts. The Company determines it has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, the Company can identify each party’s rights regarding the services and products to be transferred, the Company can identify the payment terms for the services and products, the Company has determined that the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. In general, contract terms will be reflected in a written document that is signed by both parties. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract. The Company also evaluates the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.Contracts may be modified to account for changes in contract scope or price. The Company considers contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new rights or obligations or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations of either party. Contract modifications for services and products that are distinct from the existing contract and are priced commensurate with their standalone selling price are treated as separate contracts, and are accounted for prospectively. Contract modifications for services and products that are distinct but are not priced commensurate with their standalone selling price or are not distinct from the existing contract may affect the initial transaction price or the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. In such cases, recognized revenue may be adjusted.Identification of the performance obligation in the contractPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services or products that will be transferred to the customer that are both: i.capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service or product either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from the Company or third parties, and ii.distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Table of ContentsTo the extent a contract includes multiple promised services or products, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised services or products are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised services or products are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.The Company generates revenue from the following sources, which represent the performance obligations of the Company:i.Subscription services related to the Company’s Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) offerings, including hosting;ii.Support activities that consist of email and phone support, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades released when, and if, available during the support term;iii.Self-managed software licenses related to term or perpetual agreements; andiv.Services related to the implementation and configuration of the Company’s services and products, reimbursable travel, and training.Subscriptions are typically sold with a three- to five-year initial term with a customer option to renew on an annual basis after the initial term. Term licenses generally have a two-year initial term with a customer option to renew on an annual basis after the initial term. In certain circumstances, the Company will enter into term licenses with an initial term of more than two years or a renewal period longer than one year. Support for term licenses follows the same contract periods. Professional services typically are time and materials contracts that last for an average period of approximately one year. Determination of the transaction priceThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring services and products to the customer. Consideration may vary due to discounts, incentives, and potential service level credits or contractual penalties. Variable consideration is estimated and included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that there will not be a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract. Self-managed software licenses and subscription services may be subject to either fixed or variable installments. Variable installments are generally subject to changes in a customer’s Direct Written Premium (“DWP”) or a customer’s Gross Written Premium (“GWP”). When consideration is subject to variable installments, the Company estimates variable consideration using the expected value method based on historical DWP or GWP usage to the extent that a significant revenue reversal is not probable to occur. When consideration is subject to a customer termination right, the Company estimates the total transaction price using the most likely method, and defers consideration associated with the customer’s termination right until it expires. The Company elected the practical expedient to evaluate whether a significant financing component exists when the contract term is greater than one year and the timing of revenue recognition occurs in advance of invoicing. This timing difference occurs when control of the software license is transferred at a point in time, usually at the contract onset, but the customer payments occur over time. A significant financing component generally does not exist under the Company’s standard contracting and billing practices. For example, the Company’s typical time-based licenses have a two-year initial term with the final payment due at the end of the first year and the Company’s typical subscription services are generally billed in advance of providing the services. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contractIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price (“SSP”) in relation to the total fair value of all performance obligations in the arrangement. The majority of the Company’s contracts contain multiple performance obligations, such as when licenses are sold with support, implementation services, or training services. Additionally, as customers enter into subscription agreements to migrate from an existing term license agreement, customers may be under contract for self-managed licenses and support, in addition to subscription services, for a period of time, which may require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation. Some of the Company’s performance obligations, such as support, implementation services, and training services, have observable inputs that are used to determine the SSP of those distinct performance obligations. Where SSP is not directly observable, the Company determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In the circumstances when available information to determine SSP is highly variable or uncertain, such as for our term licenses, the Company will use the residual method.Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligationTable of ContentsThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the services or products are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. The Company is principally responsible for the satisfaction of its distinct performance obligations, which are satisfied either at a point in time or over a period of time. Performance obligations satisfied at a point in timeSelf-managed term and perpetual software licenses comprise the majority of distinct performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue is recognized at the point in which the self-managed software licenses are made available to a customer. Consideration for self-managed software licenses is typically billed in advance on an annual basis over the license term. Performance obligations satisfied over a period of timeSubscriptions, support activities, and professional service arrangements comprise the majority of distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time.Revenue from subscription arrangements is recognized ratably over the subscription period using a time-based measure of progress as customers receive the benefits from their subscriptions over the contractually agreed-upon term. The Company’s subscription arrangements are generally three to five years in duration. Consideration for subscription arrangements is typically billed in advance on an annual basis over the contract period. Revenue from support activities associated with self-managed licenses is a stand-ready obligation, which is generally recognized over the contractually agreed-upon term using a time-based measure of progress as customers receive benefits from the availability of support technicians over the support period. Consideration for support activities is typically billed in advance on an annual basis. The Company’s support activities are consistently priced as a percentage of the associated self-managed software license.Revenue from professional service arrangements is recognized over the service period as the underlying services are performed. In substantially all of the Company’s professional service contracts, services are separately identifiable performance obligations for which related revenue and costs are recognized according to when each service obligation is delivered. Substantially all professional services engagements are billed and recognized on a time and materials basis. In select situations, the Company will contract professional services on a fixed fee basis, where the Company generally recognizes services revenue over time, using an input method. The measure of progress of the professional services being provided under these fixed fee arrangements is based on hours incurred compared to estimates of the total hours to complete the performance obligation.When professional services are sold with a self-managed license or subscription arrangement, the Company evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct or separately identifiable, or whether they constitute a single performance obligation. In the limited cases where professional services are not considered to be distinct from the self-managed license or subscription services, the Company will recognize revenue based on the nature and term of the combined performance obligation when control of the combined performance obligation is transferred to the customer.Balance Sheet PresentationContracts with customers are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:•Accounts receivable, net represents amounts billed to customers in accordance with contract terms for which payment has not yet been received. It is presented net of the allowances as part of current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.•Unbilled accounts receivable, net represents amounts that are unbilled due to agreed-upon contractual terms in which billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition. This situation typically occurs when the Company transfers control of self-managed software licenses to customers up-front, but invoices customers annually over the term of the license. Unbilled accounts receivable is classified as either current or non-current based on the duration of remaining time between the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the anticipated due date of the underlying receivables. Unbilled accounts receivable is evaluated for credit losses based upon the expected collectibility of future accounts receivable, customer payment history, global economic conditions, and ongoing credit evaluations of customers. Unbilled accounts receivable is presented net of allowance for credit losses, if applicable, in the consolidated balance sheets. This balance represents contract assets. Table of Contents•Contract costs include customer acquisition costs, which consist primarily of sales commissions paid to sales personnel and their related payroll taxes and referral fees paid to third-parties, and costs to fulfill a contract, which consist primarily of royalties payable to third-party software providers that support both the Company’s software offerings and support services. The short-term portion is presented as prepaid and other current assets. The long-term portion is presented as other assets.•Deferred costs represent costs related to our professional services that have been deferred to align with revenue recognition. The short-term portion is presented as prepaid and other current assets. The long-term portion is presented as other assets.•Deferred revenue, net represents amounts that have been invoiced and for which the Company has the right to bill, but that have not been recognized as revenue because the related services or products have not been transferred to the customer. Deferred revenue that will be realized during the 12-month period following the date of the consolidated balance sheets is recorded as current. The remaining deferred revenue is recorded as non-current. This balance represents contract liabilities.The Company may receive consideration from its customers in advance of performance on a portion of the contract and, on another portion of the contract, perform in advance of receiving consideration. Contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are interdependent. Therefore, contract assets and liabilities are presented net at the contract level, as either a single contract asset or a single contract liability, in the consolidated balance sheets. Remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. The Company excludes amounts related to professional services contracts that are on a time and materials basis from remaining performance obligations.Contract CostsContract costs consists of two components, customer acquisition costs and costs to fulfill a contract. Customer acquisition costs are capitalized only if the costs are incrementally incurred to obtain a customer contract and the expected amortization period is greater than one year. Contract costs are classified as either current or non-current based on the duration of time remaining between the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the anticipated amortization date of the associated costs. Capitalized customer acquisition costs related to software licenses, subscriptions, and support services are amortized over the anticipated period of time that such goods and services are expected to be provided to a customer, which the Company estimates to be approximately five years. The amortization of customer acquisition costs is classified as a sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.Costs to fulfill a contract, or fulfillment costs, are only capitalized if they relate directly to a contract with a customer, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future, and the costs are expected to be recoverable. Fulfillment costs would be generally amortized over the same period of time as the customer acquisition costs. The amortization of fulfillment costs is classified as a cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. WarrantiesThe Company generally provides a warranty for its software services and products to its customers for periods ranging from three to twelve months. The Company’s software products are generally warranted to be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and to substantially perform as described in published documentation. The Company’s services are generally warranted to be performed in a professional manner and to materially conform to the specifications set forth in the related customer contract. In the event there is a failure of such warranties, the Company generally will correct the problem or provide a reasonable workaround or replacement product. If the Company cannot correct the problem or provide a workaround or replacement product, then the customer’s remedy is generally limited to a refund of the fees paid for the non-conforming product or services. Warranty expense has been insignificant to date.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounts incurred were not material during the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.Table of ContentsStock-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method, which requires the Company to measure stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the awards and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes compensation expense net of actual forfeitures. To date, the Company has granted or assumed stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), and restricted stock units that may be earned subject to the Company’s total shareholder return ranking relative to the software companies in the S&P Software and Services Select Industry Index (“S&P Index”) over a specified performance period or periods, service periods and, in select cases, subject to certain performance conditions (“TSR PSUs”). RSAs, RSUs, PSUs, and TSR PSUs are collectively referred to as “Stock Awards.”The fair value of the Company’s RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs is equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. These awards are subject to time-based vesting, which generally occurs over a period of four years. The Company recognizes compensation expense for awards that contain only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. The Company recognizes the compensation cost for awards that contain either performance conditions, market conditions, or both using the graded vesting method and a portion of the expense may fluctuate depending on changing estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions. The fair value of the Company’s stock options and TSR PSUs are estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulation method, respectively. The assumptions utilized under these methods require judgments and estimates. Changes in these inputs and assumptions could affect the measurement of the estimated fair value of the related compensation expense of these stock options and stock awards. Compensation expense associated with TSR PSUs will be recognized over the vesting period regardless of whether the market condition is ultimately satisfied; however, the expense will be reversed if a grantee terminates prior to satisfying the requisite service period. For TSR PSUs containing an additional performance condition, a portion of the expense may fluctuate depending on estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions. All TSR PSUs will vest at the end of a three-year period.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. All deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized and is based on both positive and negative evidence about the future, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may differ materially from the statutory rate. These differences may be caused by changes in tax regulations and resulting changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance; changes in the mix and level of income or losses; changes in the expected outcome of tax audits; permanent differences for stock-based compensation, including excess tax benefits; research and development credits; the tax rate differences between the United States and foreign countries; foreign withholding taxes; certain non-deductible expenses, including executive compensation; acquisition-related expenses; and provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, a special deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, and a base erosion anti-abuse tax that may tax certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in its consolidated statement of operations.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIntangibles, Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service ContractIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract, which requires implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement if those costs would be capitalized in a software licensing arrangement under the internal-use software guidance in ASC Table of Contents350-40. On August 1, 2020 the Company adopted this ASU prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13), Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. On August 1, 2020, the Company adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedDebt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own EquityIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning August 1, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements but believes that it will negatively impact its earnings per share calculations.Other Accounting PronouncementsOther recent accounting pronouncements that will be applicable to the Company are not expected to have a material impact on its present or future financial statements.Table of Contents2.RevenueDisaggregation of RevenueRevenue by license or service type is as follows (in thousands):Fiscal years ended July 31,202120202019Subscription and SupportSubscription168,649 119,658 65,050 Support83,709 83,815 85,424 LicenseTerm license303,309 328,489 318,142 Perpetual license483 3,065 2,130 Services187,117 207,280 248,768 Total revenue$743,267 $742,307 $719,514 Revenue by revenue type and by geography is as follows (in thousands):Fiscal year ended July 31, 2021Subscription and supportLicenseServicesTotalUnited States$167,920 $180,742 $123,498 $472,160 Canada35,465 26,214 13,464 75,143 Other Americas4,234 4,651 5,307 14,192 Total Americas207,619 211,607 142,269 561,495 United Kingdom6,911 21,032 4,333 32,276 Other EMEA20,449 39,553 29,574 89,576 Total EMEA27,360 60,585 33,907 121,852 Total APAC17,379 31,600 10,941 59,920 Total revenue252,358 303,792 187,117 743,267 Fiscal year ended July 31, 2020Subscription and supportLicenseServicesTotalUnited States$139,059 $174,183 $149,297 $462,539 Canada18,216 36,184 4,595 58,995 Other Americas4,454 6,374 7,780 18,608 Total Americas161,729 216,741 161,672 540,142 United Kingdom6,942 36,185 5,397 48,524 Other EMEA19,544 43,988 26,389 89,921 Total EMEA26,486 80,173 31,786 138,445 Total APAC15,258 34,640 13,822 63,720 Total revenue203,473 331,554 207,280 742,307 Table of ContentsFiscal year ended July 31, 2019Subscription and supportLicenseServicesTotalUnited States$100,136 $179,726 $166,724 $446,586 Canada11,171 26,329 9,469 46,969 Other Americas4,450 6,576 7,092 18,118 Total Americas115,757 212,631 183,285 511,673 United Kingdom6,844 21,648 11,504 39,996 Other EMEA12,118 47,119 37,153 96,390 Total EMEA18,962 68,767 48,657 136,386 Total APAC15,755 38,874 16,826 71,455 Total revenue150,474 320,272 248,768 719,514 No country or region other than those listed above accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.Customer Contract - Related Balance Sheet AmountsAmounts related to customer contract-related arrangements are included on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):July 31, 2021July 31, 2020Unbilled accounts receivable, net103,422 84,228 Contract costs, net42,235 34,809 Deferred revenue, net145,936 132,996 Unbilled accounts receivableThe unbilled accounts receivable, net is primarily impacted by new term license deals and multi-year term license renewals, less any current year billings, of approximately $11 million and, to a lesser extent, cloud subscription orders with ramped billing schedules of approximately $8 million. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized prior to billing. Arrangements are generally billed on an annual basis over the contract term which generally ranges from two to five years.As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no allowance for credit losses associated with unbilled accounts receivable.Contract costsThe current portion of contract costs of $13.4 million and $9.6 million is included in prepaid and other current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The non-current portion of contract costs of $28.9 million and $25.2 million is included in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of July 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company amortized $11.4 million and $9.9 million of contract costs during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Deferred revenueDuring the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $116.2 million related to the Company’s deferred revenue balance reported as of July 31, 2020. Performance ObligationsThe aggregate amount of consideration allocated to performance obligations either not satisfied or partially satisfied, was approximately $844.0 million as of July 31, 2021. Subscription services are typically satisfied over three to five years, support services are generally satisfied within one year, and professional services are typically satisfied within one year. Professional services under time and material contracts are not included in the performance obligations calculations as these arrangements can be cancelled at any time.Table of Contents3.

Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.The Company applies the three-level valuation hierarchy when measuring the fair value of certain assets and liabilities:Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; andLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.

The strategic investments consist of non-marketable equity securities that do not have readily determinable market values (Level 3). The Company records these strategic investments at cost less impairment and adjusts cost for subsequent observable changes in fair value. The Company invested $2.4 million and $1.2 million in new strategic equity investments during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No impairment charges were recognized during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 while an impairment charge of $10.7 million was recognized during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 primarily due to liquidity constraints in the economic environment that limited the investee’s ability to raise funds.Table of ContentsAccrued Employee CompensationAccrued employee compensation consists of the following (in thousands):July 31, 2021July 31, 2020Bonus$48,414 $20,188 Commission11,271 7,201 Vacation23,803 20,637 Salaries, payroll taxes, and benefits18,649 10,521 Accrued employee compensation$102,137 $58,547 Other Current LiabilitiesOther current liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):July 31, 2021July 31, 2020Lease liabilities$11,624 $10,936 Accrued royalties7,525 6,651 Accrued taxes6,796 3,817 Other5,703 4,302 Other current liabilities$31,648 $25,706 Table of Contents5. Net Income (Loss) per ShareThe Company calculates basic earnings per share by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase common stock, stock awards, and the Convertible Senior Notes are considered to be common stock equivalents.The following table sets forth the computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts): Fiscal years ended July 31, 202120202019Numerator:Net income (loss)$(66,507)$(27,198)$20,732 Net income (loss) per share:Basic$(0.79)$(0.33)$0.25 Diluted$(0.79)$(0.33)$0.25 Denominator:Weighted average shares used in computing net income (loss) per share:Basic83,577,375 82,855,392 81,447,998 Weighted average effect of dilutive stock options— — 229,035 Weighted average effect of dilutive stock awards— — 1,004,181 Diluted83,577,375 82,855,392 82,681,214 The following weighted shares outstanding of potential common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted income (loss) per share for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-dilutive: Fiscal years ended July 31, 202120202019Stock options37,980 161,410 — Stock awards2,737,597 2,559,214 44,196 Convertible senior notes52,430 — — Since the Company has the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes in cash and any excess in shares of the Company’s common stock, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on net income (loss) per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given quarterly period exceeds the conversion price of $113.75 per share for the Convertible Senior Notes. In fiscal year 2021, the average market price of the Company’s common stock exceeded the conversion price only in the second quarter.Table of Contents6. Convertible Senior NotesIn March 2018, the Company offered and sold $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025. The Convertible Senior Notes were issued in accordance with the Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2018, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) (the “Base Indenture”), as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2018, between the Company and the Trustee (together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes were $387.2 million, after deducting issuance costs.The Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 1.25% per year, on March 15th and September 15th of each year. The Convertible Senior Notes will mature on March 15, 2025 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 15, 2024, the Convertible Senior Notes are convertible at the option of holders during certain periods, upon satisfaction of certain conditions. On or after October 15, 2024, the Convertible Senior Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Convertible Senior Notes will have an initial conversion rate of 8.7912 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $113.75 per share of the Company’s common stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. The Company may redeem the Convertible Senior Notes, at its option, on or after March 20, 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including at least one of the three trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Senior Notes. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) prior to the maturity date, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Convertible Senior Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.The Convertible Senior Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Senior Notes, and equal in right of payment to any of its indebtedness that is not so subordinated. The Convertible Senior Notes are effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) and any preferred equity of its current or future subsidiaries.The net carrying value of the liability component, unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs of the Convertible Senior Notes was as follows (in thousands):July 31, 2021July 31, 2020Principal$400,000 $400,000 Less unamortized:Debt discount50,198 62,508 Debt issuance costs5,977 7,284 Net carrying amount$343,825 $330,208 The effective interest rate of the liability is 5.53%.

The Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $113.75 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $153.13 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, 3.5 million shares of common stock. By entering into the Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock (or, in the event the conversion is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion its stock price exceeds the conversion price under the Convertible Senior Notes. The Capped Calls are subject to either adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including a merger event, tender offer, and a nationalization, insolvency, or delisting involving the Company. Additionally, the Capped Calls are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Calls, including change in law, insolvency filing, and hedging disruptions. The Capped Calls were recorded in the period purchased as a reduction of the Company’s additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.7. LeasesThe Company’s lease obligations consist of operating leases for office facilities and equipment, with lease periods expiring through fiscal year 2032. Some leases include one or more options to renew. Lease renewals are not assumed in the determination of the lease term until the exercise of the renewal option is deemed to be reasonably certain.Components of operating lease costs were as follows (in thousands):Fiscal years ended July 31,20212020Operating lease cost (1)$17,614 $15,275 Variable lease cost5,017 5,821 Sublease income(1,587)(1,430)Net operating lease cost$21,044 $19,666 (1) Lease expense for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less is excluded from the table above and was $1.0 million and $0.9 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Lease expense for all worldwide facilities and equipment based on the previous lease accounting standards, which was recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the various leases, was $15.5 million in fiscal year 2019.Table of ContentsFuture operating lease payments as of July 31, 2021 were as follows (in thousands):Fiscal year ending July 31,2022$16,704 202316,679 202416,575 202516,943 202617,163 Thereafter68,481 Total future lease payments152,545 Less imputed interest(25,547)Total lease liability balance$126,998 Supplemental information related to operating leases was as follows (in thousands, except for lease term and discount rate):As of July 31,20212020Operating lease assets$97,447$103,797Current portion of lease liabilities11,62410,936Non-current portion of lease liabilities115,374119,408Total lease liabilities$126,998$130,344Weighted average remaining lease term (years)8.749.27Weighted average discount rate4.20 %4.34 %Supplemental cash and non-cash information related to operating leases was as follows (in thousands):Fiscal years ended July 31,20212020Cash payments for operating leases$17,837 $9,584 Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities$6,503 $23,032 Table of Contents8.

(2) Royalty obligations primarily represent the Company’s obligations under non-cancellable agreements related to software used in certain revenue-generating agreements.(3) Purchase commitments consisted of commitments to purchase goods and services, entered into in the ordinary course of business, for which a penalty could be imposed if the agreement was cancelled for any reason other than an event of default as described by the agreement.(4) Long-term debt consists of principal and interest payments on the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes. The $400 million in principal will be due in March 2025. Legal ProceedingsFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and receives claims, arising from the normal course of business activities. The Company has not recorded any accrual for claims as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has not accrued for estimated losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as the Company has determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim against the Company because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial. The Company expenses legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.IndemnificationThe Company sells software licenses and services to its customers under Software License Agreements (“SLA”) and Software Subscription Agreements (“SSA”). SLAs and SSAs contain the terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer and generally include certain provisions for defending the customer against any claims that the Company’s software infringes upon a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. SLAs and SSAs also generally indemnify the customer against judgements, settlements, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses resulting from a claim (“Losses”) against the customer in the event the Company’s software is found to infringe upon such third-party rights. The Company has not had to reimburse any of its customers for Losses related to indemnification provisions and no material claims against the Company were outstanding as of July 31, 2021 and 2020. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under various SLAs and SSAs, the Company cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments, if any, related to indemnification provisions.The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any Table of Contentsof these persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that may enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.9.

Aggregate intrinsic value for released Stock Awards represents the total market value of released Stock Awards at their respective date of release.Certain executives and employees of the Company received PSUs and TSR PSUs in addition to RSUs. PSUs awarded in September 2020 will vest over three years with 50% vesting annually over the three year period and the remaining 50% vesting at the end of the third year. The TSR PSUs are subject to total shareholder return rankings of the Company’s common stock relative to the software companies in the S&P Index for a specified period or periods, and vest at the end of three years. The Company recognized stock-based compensation related to these performance-based and market-based stock awards of $13.9 million, $13.1 million, and $19.1 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Aggregate intrinsic value for exercised options represents the difference between the Company’s stock price at date of exercise and the exercise price.Valuation of Awards TSR PSUsThe fair values of the TSR PSUs is estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model which included the following assumptions:Fiscal years ended July 31,202120202019Expected term (in years)*2.902.88Risk-free interest rate*1.46%2.79%Expected volatility of the Company*28.4%27.2%Average expected volatility of the peer companies in the S&P Index*37.0%33%Expected dividend yield*—%—%*There were no TSR PSUs granted during fiscal year 2021.Table of ContentsThe number of TSR PSUs that may ultimately vest will vary based on the performance of the Company’s common stock relative to the shareholder return of the software companies in the S&P Index for a specified period or periods. The Monte Carlo methodology incorporates into the valuation all possible outcomes, including that the Company’s relative performance may result in no shares vesting. As a result, stock-based compensation expense is recognized regardless of the Company’s ultimate achievement of the plan’s metrics. The expense will be reversed only in the event that a grantee is terminated prior to satisfying the requisite service period.Common Stock Reserved for IssuanceAs of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share and, of these, 83,194,157 and 83,461,925 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, respectively. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:July 31, 2021July 31, 2020Exercise of stock options to purchase common stock25,278 80,332 Vesting of stock awards2,394,968 2,445,698 Shares available under stock plans5,014,069 23,460,234 Total common stock reserved for issuance7,434,315 25,986,264 Equity Incentive PlansOn December 15, 2020, the Company’s stockholders adopted the 2020 Stock Plan (“2020 Plan”) for the purpose of granting equity-based incentive awards. The Company initially reserved 5,000,000 shares of its common stock for the issuance of awards under the 2020 Plan. The shares available for issuance are subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other defined changes in the Company’s capitalization. The 2020 Plan replaced the Company’s 2011 Stock Plan; however, awards outstanding under the 2011 Stock Plan will continue to be governed by their existing terms. The shares the Company issues under the 2020 Plan will be from the Company's pool of authorized but unissued shares. The shares of common stock underlying any awards under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, canceled, held back upon exercise or settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without any issuance of stock or are otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) are added back to the shares of stock available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. Stock Repurchase ProgramIn October 2020, the Company's board of directors authorized and approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases under the program may be made from time to time, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions and otherwise, at the discretion of management of the Company and in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and other applicable legal requirements. Such repurchases may also be made in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 trading plans entered into by the Company.During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 1,488,991 shares of common stock at an average price of $109.17 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $162.5 million. As of July 31, 2021, $37.5 million remained available for future repurchases.10. Income TaxesThe Company recognized an income tax benefit of $37.8 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to an income tax provision of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase in our income tax benefit for fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax net loss, the release of a reserve for an uncertain tax position, and the impact related to the tax status change of certain foreign subsidiaries for U.S. tax purposes, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate of 36% for fiscal year 2021, differs from the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21% mainly due to permanent differences for stock-based compensation, including excess tax benefits, the release of a reserve for an uncertain tax position, research and development credits, the tax status change of certain foreign subsidiaries, change in valuation allowance, and certain non-deductible expenses including executive compensation limitation.

A valuation allowance of $44.8 million and $37.2 million remained as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily related to California and Federal deferred tax assets. The increase of $7.6 million in the valuation allowance in the current fiscal year relates primarily to net operating losses and income tax credits in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is expected to be recognized.As of July 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. Federal, California, and other states net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $282.2 million, $61.6 million and $144.0 million, respectively. The U.S. Federal and California NOL carryforwards will start to expire in 2029 and 2023, respectively.As of July 31, 2021, the Company had research and development tax credits (“R&D credit”) carryforwards of the following (in thousands):U.S. Federal$52,306 California43,748 Total R&D credit carryforwards$96,054 The U.S. Federal R&D credits will start to expire in 2023 and the California R&D tax credits do not expire.Federal and California laws impose restrictions on the utilization of NOL carryforwards and R&D credit carryforwards in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, as defined by Internal Revenue Code 382 and 383. The Company experienced an ownership change in the past that does not materially impact the availability of its carryforwards. However, should there be an ownership change in the future, the Company’s ability to utilize existing carryforwards could be substantially restricted.Table of ContentsAs of July 31, 2021, the Company has recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries of $0.6 million. The Company may repatriate foreign earnings in the future to the extent that the repatriation is not restricted by local laws or there are no substantial incremental costs associated with such repatriation.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsActivity related to unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): Fiscal years ended July 31, 202120202019Unrecognized tax benefits - beginning of period$23,690 $11,633 $10,321 Gross increases - prior period tax positions65 3,401 98 Gross decreases - prior period tax positions(7,769)(147)(88)Gross increases - current period tax positions1,152 8,803 1,302 Unrecognized tax benefits - end of period$17,138 $23,690 $11,633 During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $6.6 million. As of July 31, 2021, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $10.9 million that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate as certain unrecognized tax benefits have a valuation allowance. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations. As of July 31, 2021, the accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial. The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income taxes in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. If the Company utilizes NOL carryforwards or tax credits in future years, the U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. tax authorities may examine the tax returns covering the period in which the net operating losses and tax credits arose. As a result, the Company’s tax returns in the U.S. and California remain open to examination from fiscal years 2002 through 2021. The Company received an immaterial proposed assessment from the California Franchise Tax Board for the state income tax returns filed for fiscal years 2018 and 2017. The Company is currently reviewing this proposed assessment and may appeal. Any impact on the consolidated financial statements related to the assessment will be recorded in the quarter when the Company concludes the examination.11. Defined Contribution and Other Post-Retirement PlansThe Company’s employee savings and retirement plan in the United States is qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees on the Company’s U.S. payroll are automatically enrolled when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. Upon enrollment employees are provided with tax-deferred salary deductions and various investment options. Employees may contribute up to 60% of their eligible salary up to the statutory prescribed annual limit. The Company matches employees’ contributions up to $5,000 per participant per calendar year. Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries also have defined contribution plans in which a majority of its employees participate and the Company makes matching contributions. The Company’s contributions to its 401(k) and foreign subsidiaries’ plans were $11.8 million, $10.7 million, and $9.9 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.12. Segment InformationThe Company operates in one segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), its Chief Executive Officer, manages the Company’s operations on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources. When evaluating the Company’s financial performance, the CODM reviews separate revenue information for the Company’s subscription, support, term license, perpetual license, and services offerings, while all other financial information is reviewed on a consolidated basis. The Company’s principal operations and decision-making functions are located in the United States.Table of ContentsThe Company’s long-lived assets for this disclosure is defined as property and equipment and operating lease assets.

The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. The Company has not completed its acquisition accounting for this transaction, and is in the process of evaluating the impact of the business combination on its consolidated financial statements.Table of ContentsItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountant on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone. Item 9A.Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were deemed effective as of July 31, 2021.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, using the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 framework. Based on this assessment and those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at a reasonable level of assurance, as of July 31, 2021.Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inherent Limitations of Internal ControlsOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Table of ContentsChanges in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Item 9B.Other InformationNone.Table of ContentsPART III Item 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers, and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer.

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, but are not limited to, statements about: • our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin and operating expenses; • maintaining and expanding our customer base and increasing our average subscription revenue per customer; • the impact of competition in our industry and innovation by our competitors; • our anticipated growth and expectations regarding our ability to manage our future growth; • our expectations regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, and the markets in which we and our partners and customers operate; • our anticipated areas of investments, including sales and marketing, research and development, customer service and support, data center infrastructure and service capabilities, and expectations relating to such investments; • our predictions about industry and market trends; • our ability to anticipate and address the evolution of technology and the technological needs of our customers, to roll-out upgrades to our existing software platform and to develop new and enhanced applications to meet the needs of our customers; • our ability to maintain our brand and inbound marketing, selling and servicing thought leadership position; • the impact of our corporate culture and our ability to attract, hire and retain necessary qualified employees to expand our operations; • the anticipated effect on our business of litigation to which we are or may become a party; • our ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies and assets; • our plans regarding declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future; and • our ability to stay abreast of new or modified laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business both in the United States and internationally. 1 We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “HubSpot,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to HubSpot, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 2 Risk Factor Summary The risk factors detailed in Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and a reader should carefully consider them. Those risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. The following is a summary of the risk factors detailed in Item 1A: • The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. • We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future. • We are dependent upon customer renewals, the addition of new customers, increased revenue from existing customers and the continued growth of the market for a CRM Platform. • We face significant competition from both established and new companies offering marketing, sales and customer service software and other related applications, as well as internally developed software, which may harm our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers and grow our business. • Failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing, sales, customer service, and content management capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform. • If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our CRM Platform may become less competitive. • Our ability to introduce new products and features is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed. • Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver our platform to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue. • If our CRM Platform has outages or fails due to defects or similar problems, and if we fail to correct any defect or other software problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs. • If our or our customers’ security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to data of our customers or their customers is otherwise obtained, our CRM Platform may be perceived as not being secure, our customers may be harmed and may curtail or cease their use of our platform, our reputation may be damaged and we may incur significant liabilities. • We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance. • If we do not accurately predict subscription renewal rates or otherwise fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. • Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing. 3 PART 1 ITEM I. BUSINESS Overview We help scaling companies deliver a delightful customer experience through our cloud-based customer relationship management (“CRM”) Platform. Our CRM Platform includes marketing, sales, service, and content management system, (“CMS”), as well as other tools and integrations, that enable companies to attract, engage, and delight customers throughout the customer experience. Additionally, we provide education, services and support to help customers be successful with our platform. We focus on selling to mid-market business-to-business (“B2B”) companies, which we define as companies that have between 2 and 2,000 employees. We sell our CRM Platform on a subscription basis. In 2020, our total revenue was $883.0 million, and we incurred a net loss of $85.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,225 full-time employees and 103,994 total customers of varying sizes in more than 120 countries. Our company was formed as a limited liability company in Delaware on April 4, 2005. We converted to a Delaware corporation on June 7, 2007. Our principal executive offices are located at 25 First Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and our main telephone number is 888-482-7768. Our website address is https://www.hubspot.com. Information contained on or that can be accessed through our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and inclusions of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are inactive textual references only. The HubSpot Approach Our CRM Platform features a central database of lead and customer interactions and integrated applications designed to help businesses attract visitors to their websites, convert visitors into leads, close leads into customers, and delight customers so they become promoters of those businesses. Designed to Help Companies Grow Better. Our CRM Platform was architected from the ground up to enable businesses to transform their marketing, sales, services, and content management playbook to meet the demands of customers today. Our CRM Platform includes both a system of record for maintaining a unified view of the customer experience and a system of engagement for efficiently engaging customers through search engine optimization (“SEO”), web content, social, blogging, email, marketing automation, messaging, support ticketing, knowledge base and more. Ease of Use of a Single, Extensible Platform. We provide a set of integrated applications on a common platform, which offers businesses ease of use and simplicity. Our CRM Platform has one login, one user interface, one database, and one team for support. Our CRM Platform starts free and grows with our customers. It is designed to scale its power and technical sophistication without losing its ease-of-use. In addition to being a comprehensive suite itself, our CRM Platform seamlessly integrates with hundreds of external applications, making it easy to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform and customize it for any business. Power of a Unified Customer View. At the core of our CRM Platform is a single CRM database for each business that captures its lead and customer activity throughout the customer lifecycle. Our CRM Platform creates a unified timeline incorporating all the interactions with a particular customer. In contrast to many CRM suites which are cobbled together, HubSpot has a set of core functionalities, including reporting, content, messaging, data, and automation, which runs across our product lines, which we refer to as Hubs. Scalability. Our CRM Platform was designed and built to serve a large number of customers with demanding use cases. Our CRM Platform currently processes billions of data points each week, and we use leading global cloud infrastructure providers and our own automation technology to dynamically allocate capacity to handle processing workloads of all sizes. We have built our CRM Platform on modern, scalable distributed technologies. We built the infrastructure to support hundreds of microservices and can easily add new features and capabilities to the CRM Platform. We utilize a variety of open-source distributed systems including HBase, Kafka, Vitess, and Elasticsearch to scale our data collection and processing. Our scalability gives us flexibility for future growth and enables us to service a large variety of businesses of different sizes across different industries. Extensible and Open Architecture. Our CRM Platform features a variety of open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that allows easy integration of our platform with other applications. We enable our customers to connect our platform to their other applications, such as ecommerce, event management and videoconferencing applications. By connecting third-party applications, our customers can leverage our centralized inbound database to perform additional functions and analysis. 4 Our Competitive Strengths We believe that our market leadership position is based on the following key strengths: Leading Platform. We have designed and built a world-class CRM Platform. We believe our customers choose our CRM Platform over others because of its powerful, integrated, and easy-to-use applications. We built HubSpot on a single, unified, and intuitive platform, which we believe contrasts positively with many other CRM suites. Market Leadership and Strong Brand. We are a recognized thought leader in the cloud-based marketing, sales, customer service, and content management software industry with a leading brand. Our founders, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, wrote the best-selling marketing book Inbound Marketing: Get Found Using Google, Social Media and Blogs. Our marketing, sales, service, and content management experience attracts, engages, and delights customers by being more relevant, more helpful, more personalized, and less interruptive than traditional marketing and sales tactics. Our INBOUND event is one of the largest inbound industry conference events with registered attendance increasing from 1,100 in 2011 to over 26,000 in 2019. In 2020, we shifted our INBOUND event to a virtual-only experience due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we had more than 70,000 registered attendees. Large and Growing Solutions Partner Program. A Solutions Partner is a service provider that helps businesses with strategy, execution, and implementation of go-to-market activities and technology solutions. Our Solutions Partners promote our brand and offer our CRM Platform to their clients. Solutions Partners and customers referred to us by our Solutions Partners represented approximately 35% of our Total Customers, as defined in our Key Business Metrics in Item 7, as of December 31, 2020, and approximately 43% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. These Solutions Partners help us to promote the vision of the inbound experience, efficiently reach new mid-market businesses at scale, and provide our mutual customers with more diverse and higher-touch services. Freemium Pricing Strategy. Our freemium model attracts customers who begin using our CRM Platform through our free products and then upgrade to our paid Hubs. Through our freemium products, our customers are able to receive value from HubSpot before converting to a paid product or engaging with sales. Mid-Market Focus. We believe we have significant competitive advantages reaching mid-market businesses and efficiently reach this market at scale as a result of our inbound methodology, freemium pricing strategy, and our Solutions Partner channel. Powerful Network Effects. We have built a large and growing ecosystem around our CRM Platform and company. Thousands of our customers integrate third-party applications with our CRM Platform. We believe this ecosystem drives more businesses and professionals to embrace the inbound playbook. As our engaged audience grows, more Solutions Partners collaborate with us, more third-party developers integrate their applications with our CRM Platform, and more professionals complete our certification programs, all of which help to drive more businesses to adopt our CRM Platform. Our Growth Strategy The key elements to our growth strategy are: Grow Our Customer Base. The market for our CRM Platform is large and underserved. Mid-market businesses are particularly underserved by existing point application vendors and often lack sufficient resources to implement complex solutions. Our all-in-one CRM Platform allows mid-market businesses to efficiently adopt and execute an effective inbound marketing, sales, customer service, and content management strategy to help them expand and grow. We will continue to leverage our inbound go-to-market approach, freemium pricing strategy and our network of Solutions Partners to keep growing our business. Increase Revenue from Existing Customers. With 103,994 Total Customers in more than 120 countries spanning many industries, we believe we have a significant opportunity to increase revenue from our existing customers. We plan to increase revenue from our existing customers by expanding their use of our CRM Platform by upselling additional offerings and features, adding additional users, and cross-selling our marketing, sales, service, and content management products to existing customers through touchless or low touch in-product purchases. Our scalable pricing model allows us to capture more spend as our customers grow, increase the number of their customers and prospects managed on our CRM Platform, and offer additional functionality available from our higher price tiers and add-ons, providing us with a substantial opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships. Keep Expanding Internationally. There is a significant opportunity for our CRM Platform outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 50% of our Total Customers were located outside of the United States and these customers generated approximately 43% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We sell to those international customers from our U.S., European, Asia Pacific, and South American based operations. We intend to grow our presence in international markets 5 through additional investments in local sales, marketing and professional service capabilities, as well as by leveraging our Solutions Partner network. We have opened eight international offices and plan to open additional international offices. We have significant website traffic from regions outside the United States, and we believe that markets outside the United States represent a significant growth opportunity. Continue to Innovate and Expand Our CRM Platform. Mid-market businesses are increasingly realizing the value of having an integrated marketing, sales, customer service, and content management platform. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity by introducing new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform. Selectively Pursue Acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and teams that would allow us to add new features and functionalities to our platform and accelerate the pace of our innovation. Our CRM Platform Our CRM Platform features integrated applications and tools that enable companies to create a cohesive and adaptable customer experience. Each Hub can be used standalone or in conjunction with the other Hubs. Our Hubs are available in both free and paid tiers (i.e., Starter, Professional and Enterprise) with gradually increasing levels of functionality that support the needs of our customers as they see success with our tools and their businesses grow. HubSpot CRM The core of our CRM Platform is a single database of lead and customer information that allows businesses to track their interactions with contacts and customers, manage their sales activities, and report on their pipeline and sales. This allows a complete view of lead and customer interactions across all of our integrated Hubs, giving our CRM Platform substantial power. This integration makes it possible to personalize every aspect of the customer interaction across web content, social media engagement, and email messages across devices, including mobile. The integrated Hubs on our CRM Platform have a common user interface and are accessed through a single login. There is a free version of HubSpot CRM that can be used standalone, or with any combination of CMS Hub, Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and/or Service Hub. Marketing Hub Marketing Hub is an all-in-one toolset for marketers to attract, engage, and nurture new leads towards sales readiness over the entire customer lifecycle.

Businesses can empower their teams with tools that deliver a personalized experience for prospects with less work for sales representatives.

Features include: website pages, business blogging, smart content, landing pages and forms, SEO tools, forms and lead flow, web analytics reporting, calls-to-action, and file manager. 6 Platform Application (“App”) Partners Businesses that use software outside of HubSpot can leverage our ecosystem of third-party integrations. We make it easy to find and install new or existing software solutions that complement our CRM Platform. Over 600 integrations and applications are available for our users, across a wide range of categories, including integrations with leading social media, email, sales, video, analytics, content and webinar tools. Our Services We complement our product offerings with professional services, customer success and support, which we view as critical elements of ensuring the long-term retention of our customers. The majority of our services and support is offered over email, phone, chat applications and via web meeting technology rather than in-person, which is a more efficient business model for us and our customers. Professional Services. We offer professional services to educate and train customers on how to leverage our CRM Platform to transform how their business attracts, engages and delights customers. Depending on which Hubs and services a customer purchases, they receive one-on-one training and guidance from one of our onboarding or technical specialists by web meeting and can purchase additional group training and education in online or in-person classes. Our professional services are also available to customers who need additional assistance on a one-time or ongoing basis for an additional fee. Customer Success. Our customers have access to a Customer Success Manager (“CSM”) or Customer Success Team (“CST”) which are responsible for our customers’ long term success, retention and growth on the HubSpot platform. Our CSMs and CSTs address the unique needs and goals of our customers through a series of ongoing interactions and strategy calls on how to best engage and use our CRM Platform. Support. In addition to assistance provided by our online articles and customer discussion forums, we offer phone and/or email and chat based support, which is included in the cost of a subscription for our Hubs. Phone support is available starting at the Professional product level for all Hubs while email and chat based support is available for Starter Hubs. We strive to maintain an exceptional quality of customer service. We continuously monitor key customer service metrics such as phone hold time, ticket response time and ticket resolution rates, and we monitor the customer satisfaction of our customer support interactions. We believe our customer support is an important reason why businesses choose our CRM Platform and recommend it to their colleagues. Our Total Customers As of December 31, 2020, we had 103,994 Total Customers in more than 120 countries, representing many industries. No single customer represented more than one percent of our revenue in 2020, 2019, or 2018. Our Technology Our Total Customers have chosen us as their CRM Platform, which we architected and built to be secure, highly distributed and highly scalable. Since our founding, we have embraced rapid, iterative product development lifecycles, cloud automation and open-source technologies, including big data platforms, to power marketing, sales, service, and content management programs and provide insights not previously possible or available. Our CRM Platform is a multi-tenant, single code-based, globally available software-as-a-service delivered through APIs, web browsers or mobile applications. Our commitment to a highly available, reliable, and scalable platform for businesses of all sizes is accomplished through the use of these technologies. Platform Approach. We built HubSpot on a single platform with reusable and composable libraries, allowing us to rapidly address new feature areas and bring new products to market that have a consistent user experience and data model. We have built this platform with scale in mind, supporting thousands of components including hundreds of microservices, Modern Database Architecture. We process billions of data points weekly across various channels, including social media, email, SEO and website visits, and continue to drive nearly real-time analytics across these channels. This is possible because we built our database from the ground up using distributed big data technologies such as HBase, Elasticsearch and Kafka to both process and analyze the large amounts of data we collect. We also utilize Vitess to operate MySQL at scale, allowing our engineers to choose the best datastore for each task. Agility. Our infrastructure and development and software release processes allow us to update our platform for specific groups of customers or our entire customer base at any time. This means we can rapidly innovate and deliver new functionality frequently, 7 without waiting for quarterly or annual release cycles. We typically deploy updates to our software platform thousands of times a day, enabling us to gather immediate customer feedback and improve our product quickly and continuously. Cost leverage. Because our CRM Platform was built on an almost exclusive footprint of open-source software and designed to operate in cloud-based data centers, we have benefited from large-scale price reductions by these cloud computing service providers as they continue to innovate and compete for market share. As our processing volume continues to grow, we continue to receive larger volume discounts on a per-unit basis for costs such as storage, bandwidth and computing capacity. We also believe that our extensive use of open-source software will provide additional leverage as we scale our CRM Platform and infrastructure. Scalability. By leveraging leading cloud infrastructure providers along with our automated technology stack, we are able to scale workloads of varying sizes at any time. This allows us to handle customers of all sizes and demands without traditional operational limitations such as network bandwidth, computing cycles, or storage capacity as we can scale our platform on-demand. Reliability. Customer data is distributed and processed across multiple data centers within a region to provide redundancy. We built our CRM platform on a distributed computing architecture with reduced single points of failure and we operate across data center boundaries daily. In addition to datacenter level redundancy, this architecture supports multiple live copies of each data set along with snapshot capabilities for faster, point-in-time data recovery instead of traditional backup and restore methodologies. Security. We leverage industry standard network and perimeter defense technologies, distributed denial-of-service (“DDoS”), protection systems (including web application firewalls) and enterprise grade domain name system (“DNS”), services across multiple vendors. Our data-center providers operate and certify to high industry compliance levels. Due to the broad footprint of our customer base, we regularly test and evaluate our platform with trusted third-party vendors to ensure the security and integrity of our services. Marketing and Sales We believe we are a global leader in implementing an inbound experience in marketing and sales. We believe that our marketing and sales model provides us with a competitive advantage, especially when targeting mid-market businesses, because we can attract and engage these businesses efficiently and at scale. Inbound Marketing. Our marketing team attracts new leads each month through our industry-leading blog and other content, free tools, large social media following, high search engine rankings and personalized website and email content. In addition, we are generating leads for new and add-on product purchases through content and offers delivered through our CRM Platform to existing customers. Inbound Direct Sales. Our sales representatives are based in our offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dublin, Ireland, Sydney, Australia, Singapore, Tokyo, Japan, Berlin, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogotá, Columbia, and use phone, email, and web meetings to interact with prospects and customers. The majority of revenue generated by our sales representatives originates with inbound leads produced by our marketing efforts. In addition, through our freemium products and in-product cross-sell offerings, we close new business with little or no interaction by our sales representatives. Inbound Channel Sales. In addition to our direct sales team, we have sales representatives that manage relationships with our worldwide network of Solutions Partners who both use our platform for their own businesses and also, on a commissioned basis, refer customers to us. These Solutions Partners collaborate with us not only to leverage our software platform and educational resources, but also to build their own business by offering new services and shifting their revenue mix to include recurring revenue streams. COVID-19 Pandemic In March 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a global pandemic (the “pandemic”). This pandemic is having widespread, rapidly-evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. While the pandemic has not had a material adverse financial impact on our business to date, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance will depend on future developments and conditions. We are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic and developments related thereto and our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers, and ensuring business continuity. For discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report. 8 Human Capital Management Helping millions of organizations grow better requires a truly remarkable team. We are passionate about building a company culture where people can do their best work. Our company culture and our people are not just human resources priorities but critical business priorities. As a result, we consistently focus on how we can continue to help employees grow, both personally and professionally. Since 2012, we have expanded beyond our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters to several offices globally and have built a large remote community. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,225 full-time employees, or HubSpotters. Of these, 2,813 are in North and Latin America, 1,082 are in Europe, and 330 are in the Asia Pacific region. • Culture and Values. Our award-winning culture is built on the firm belief that personal and professional growth is just as important as business growth. We believe the best people do not only fit our culture, they further it. In 2013, we published the HubSpot Culture Code, which outlines our core company values, including transparency, autonomy, flexibility, and HEART. HEART is at the center of who we are and represents the five traits we value the most in HubSpotters: Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable and Transparent. The Culture Code has garnered more than five million views and is a top reason candidates say they are drawn to working at HubSpot. A copy of our Culture Code can be found at: https://network.hubspot.com/slides/the-hubspot-culture-code. • Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. We have launched various initiatives to further our goal of being a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace. We have a team dedicated to diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives, including but not limited to: hiring goals focused on increasing black, indigenous and people of color representation company-wide, anti-racism training for employees and managers, key external partnerships, and our annual diversity report. In addition, we have numerous active employee resource groups, including Women@HubSpot, People of Color at HubSpot, BLACKhub, the LGBTQ+ Alliance, and Families@HubSpot, as well as a variety of interest groups globally including age inclusion, ability and accessibility, and veterans. • Compensation and Benefits. We provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees globally. Our compensation packages may include base salary, commission or semi-annual bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We also offer general employee medical and dental plans, unlimited vacation, life and disability insurance, and Section 401(k) plan matching contributions designed to provide employee benefits competitive with those offered by our peers and other companies with which we compete for talent. In addition, we offer an employee stock purchase plan, under which eligible employees can voluntarily opt in to buy HubSpot common stock at a discount from the fair market value of the stock as determined on specific dates twice a year. We evaluate both compensation and benefit offerings on an annual basis to ensure competitiveness of both programs and we make adjustments as needed. • Workplace awards. We are proud to be named a Best Place to Work in 2020 and 2021 by Glassdoor. We have also been recognized as a top workplace in 2020 by Great Place to Work, the Boston Globe, the Boston Business Journal, and more. We are also honored in a number of categories by Comparably's workplace awards in 2020 including Best CEOs, Best Companies for Women, Best Companies for Diversity, Best Overall Company Culture, and a Best Company for Employee Happiness. • Hybrid Culture and COVID-19. Like other companies, we have learned to adapt during the pandemic. We have prioritized employee safety and transparency during the pandemic and continue to do so, ensuring all employees are set up to work remotely and providing clarity on office closures and evolving guidelines, where possible. In the third quarter of 2020, we made the decision to permanently move to a hybrid workplace model, which means that as of January 1, 2021, our employees will have the option to be fully remote, work full-time from one of our offices, or have the flexibility to work between office and remotely. This move provides our employees with continued flexibility, following the pandemic, to work in person, remotely, or in a hybrid model. This will enable us to grow better in serving our customers. Competition Our market is evolving, highly competitive and fragmented, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are: o vision for the market, product strategy and pace of innovation; o inbound marketing focus and domain expertise; o integrated all-in-one CRM Platform; o breadth and depth of product functionality; 9 o ease of use; o scalable, open architecture; o time to value and total cost of ownership; o integration with third-party applications and data sources; o name recognition and brand reputation; and o “freemium” go-to-market motion. We believe we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. We face intense competition from other software companies that develop marketing, sales, service, and content management software. Our competitors offer various point applications that provide certain functions and features that we provide, including: o cloud-based marketing automation providers; o content management systems; o email marketing software vendors; o sales force automation and CRM software vendors o customer service platform vendors; and o large-scale enterprise suites. In addition, instead of using our CRM Platform, some prospective customers may elect to combine disparate point applications, such as content management, marketing automation, analytics, social media management, ticketing, and conversational bots. We expect that we will develop and introduce, or acquire, applications serving customer-facing and other front office functions. Intellectual Property Our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our technology, will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We protect our intellectual property through trade secrets law, copyrights, trademarks, patents, and contracts. Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property. We have 3 issued U.S. Patents, 2 allowed patent pending issuance, 7 U.S. utility patents applications pending, and 2 provisional patents filed. We intend to pursue and are pursuing additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. In addition to the foregoing, we have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, and companies with which we conduct business. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective intellectual property, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Financial Information About Segments We operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is our chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The CODM evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. See Footnote 10 within the consolidated financial statements for information by geographic area.

RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”), was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, (the “pandemic”). The pandemic, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. Our operations have also been impacted by a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control. For example, many cities, counties, states, and even countries have imposed or may impose a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees, partners and customers to limit the spread of the pandemic, including physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential business, quarantines, work-from-home directives, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on public gatherings. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. In March 2020, we temporarily closed our global offices, including our corporate headquarters, suspended all company-related travel, and all HubSpot employees globally were required to work from home for several months during the height of the pandemic. We shifted our Solutions Partner events and INBOUND 2020 to virtual-only experiences and have cancelled other customer and industry events. Although we have begun to slowly re-open our offices on a staggered, region-by-region basis in accordance with local authority guidelines, we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. All of these changes may disrupt the way we operate our business. Given that the economic consequences of the pandemic have been exceptionally challenging for many of our customers and prospects, we have also implemented certain changes to our pricing structure, including reducing prices on our Starter Growth Suite, offering certain product functionality free of charge for a limited time, suspending marketing email send limits for a limited time, and offering a one-time six-month advance on commissions to certain of our Solutions Partners. Moreover, the conditions caused by the pandemic may affect the rate of spending on software products and may adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our offerings; the timing of our current or prospective customers’ purchasing decisions; pricing discounts or extended payment terms; reductions in the amount or duration of customers’ subscription contracts; or increase customer attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance. If the pandemic has a substantial impact on the ability of our customers to purchase our offerings, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. The duration and extent of the impact from the pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the disruption caused by such actions, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including, in particular, risks related to our dependence on customer renewals, the addition of new customers and increased revenue from existing customer, risks that our operating results could be negatively affected by changes in the sizes or types of businesses that purchase our platform and the risk that weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations. 12 We are dependent upon customer renewals, the addition of new customers, increased revenue from existing customers and the continued growth of the market for a CRM Platform. We derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our CRM Platform. The market for inbound marketing, sales and customer service products is still evolving, and competitive dynamics may cause pricing levels to change as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of point applications and different approaches to enable businesses to address their respective needs. As a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our platform and may be unable to renew existing customer agreements or enter into new customer agreements at the same prices and upon the same terms that we have historically. In addition, our growth strategy involves a scalable pricing model (including freemium versions of our products) intended to provide us with an opportunity to increase the value of our customer relationships over time as we expand their use of our platform, sell to other parts of their organizations, cross-sell our sales products to existing marketing product customers and vice versa through touchless or low touch in product purchases, and upsell additional offerings and features. If our cross-selling efforts are unsuccessful or if our existing customers do not expand their use of our platform or adopt additional offerings and features, our operating results may suffer. Our subscription renewal rates may decrease, and any decrease could harm our future revenue and operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our platform after the expiration of their subscription periods, substantially all of which are one year or less. In addition, our customers may seek to renew for lower subscription tiers, for fewer contacts or seats, or for shorter contract lengths. Also, customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions for a variety of reasons. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including limited customer resources, pricing changes, the prices of services offered by our competitors, adoption and utilization of our platform and add-on applications by our customers, adoption of our new products, customer satisfaction with our platform, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers’ spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our platform or decrease the amount they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. In addition, a subscription model creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash flows. A portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. We face significant competition from both established and new companies offering marketing, sales and customer service software and other related applications, as well as internally developed software, which may harm our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers and grow our business. The marketing, sales, customer service, and content management software market is evolving, highly competitive and significantly fragmented. With the introduction of new technologies and the potential entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase renewals and maintain our prices. We face intense competition from other software companies that develop marketing, sales, customer service, and content management software and from marketing services companies that provide interactive marketing services. Competition could significantly impede our ability to sell subscriptions to our CRM Platform on terms favorable to us. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products less competitive, or obsolete. In addition, if these competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality to our platform, we may need to decrease the prices or accept less favorable terms for our platform subscriptions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins will be reduced and our operating results will be negatively affected. Our competitors include: • cloud-based marketing automation providers; • email marketing software vendors; • sales force automation and CRM software vendors; • large-scale enterprise suites; • customer service software providers; and • content management systems. 13 In addition, instead of using our platform, some prospective customers may elect to combine disparate point applications, such as content management, marketing automation, CRM, analytics and social media management. We expect that new competitors, such as enterprise software vendors that have traditionally focused on enterprise resource planning or other applications supporting back office functions, will develop and introduce applications serving customer-facing and other front office functions. This development could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, sales force automation and CRM vendors could acquire or develop applications that compete with our marketing software offerings. Some of these companies have acquired social media marketing and other marketing software providers to integrate with their broader offerings. Our current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, and may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may respond faster to new technologies and undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their products. In a few cases, these vendors may also be able to offer marketing, sales, customer service and content management software at little or no additional cost by bundling it with their existing suite of applications. To the extent any of our competitors has existing relationships with potential customers for either marketing software or other applications, those customers may be unwilling to purchase our platform because of their existing relationships with our competitor. If we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our CRM Platform could substantially decline. In addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be adversely affected. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic distribution and technology partners or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote and implement our platform. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We have experienced rapid growth and organizational change in recent periods and expect continued future growth. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately. Our head count and operations have grown substantially. For example, we had 4,225 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020, as compared with 3,387 as of December 31, 2019 and we have opened 8 international offices since 2012. We also plan to open additional offices in the future. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate further growth will be required to address increases in our product offerings and continued expansion. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to recruit, hire, train, manage and integrate a significant number of qualified managers, technical personnel and employees in specialized roles within our company, including in technology, sales and marketing. Furthermore, preservation of our corporate culture has been made more difficult as our work force has been working from home in connection with restrictions placed upon businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A long-term continuation of these restrictions could, among other things, negatively impact employee morale and productivity. Any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. If we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, if our new employees perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in recruiting, hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or retaining these or our existing employees, it could materially impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our platform, all of which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to manage the expected continued growth of our head count, operations and geographic expansion, we will need to continue to improve our information technology infrastructure, operational, financial and management systems and procedures. Our anticipated additional head count and capital investments will increase our costs, which will make it more difficult for us to address any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to successfully execute our business plan, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing, sales, customer service, and content management capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform. To increase Total Customers and achieve broader market acceptance of our CRM Platform, we will need to expand our marketing, sales, customer service and content management operations, including our sales force and third-party channel partners. We will continue to dedicate significant resources to inbound sales and marketing programs. The effectiveness of our inbound sales and marketing and third-party channel partners has varied over time and may vary in the future and depends on our ability to maintain and improve our CRM Platform. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. Our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated 14 revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective. The rate of growth of our business depends on the continued participation and level of service of our Solutions Partners. We rely on our Solutions Partners to provide certain services to our customers, as well as pursue sales of our CRM Platform to customers. To the extent we do not attract new Solutions Partners, or existing or new Solutions Partners do not refer a growing number of customers to us, our revenue and operating results would be harmed. In addition, if our Solutions Partners do not continue to provide services to our customers, we would be required to provide such services ourselves either by expanding our internal team or engaging other third-party providers, which would increase our operating costs. If we fail to maintain our inbound thought leadership position, our business may suffer. We believe that maintaining our thought leadership position in inbound marketing, sales, services and content management is an important element in attracting new customers. We devote significant resources to develop and maintain our thought leadership position, with a focus on identifying and interpreting emerging trends in the inbound experience, shaping and guiding industry dialog and creating and sharing the best inbound practices. Our activities related to developing and maintaining our thought leadership may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in such effort. We rely upon the continued services of our management and employees with domain expertise with inbound marketing, sales, services, and content management, and the loss of any key employees in this area could harm our competitive position and reputation. If we fail to successfully grow and maintain our thought leadership position, we may not attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers, and our business could suffer. If we fail to further enhance our brand and maintain our existing strong brand awareness, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our financial condition may suffer. We believe that our development of the HubSpot brand is critical to achieving widespread awareness of our existing and future inbound experience solutions, and, as a result, is important to attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expenses, and we believe that this investment has resulted in strong brand recognition in the B2B market. Successful promotion and maintenance of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide a reliable and useful CRM Platform at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer. If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our CRM Platform may become less competitive. Our future success depends on our ability to adapt and innovate our CRM Platform. To attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers, we need to continue to enhance and improve our offerings to meet customer needs at prices that our customers are willing to pay. Such efforts will require adding new functionality and responding to technological advancements, which will increase our research and development costs. If we are unable to develop new applications that address our customers’ needs, or to enhance and improve our platform in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market acceptance of our platform. Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. Access and use of our CRM Platform is provided via the cloud, which, itself, was disruptive to the previous enterprise software model. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver inbound marketing software and related applications at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely affect our ability to compete. If we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation may suffer. High-quality education, training and customer support are important for the successful marketing, sale and use of our CRM Platform and for the renewal of existing customers. Providing this education, training and support requires that our personnel who manage our online training resource, HubSpot Academy, or provide customer support have specific inbound experience domain knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers use multiple applications within our CRM Platform and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional functionality and services to, or to retain, existing customers may suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed. 15 We may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers’ growing needs and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed. As usage of our CRM Platform grows and as customers use our platform for additional inbound applications, such as sales and services, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating with third-party systems and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and professional services, to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer demographics change over time. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our CRM Platform to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could impede our revenue growth and harm our reputation. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management’s time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely affect our financial results. Our ability to introduce new products and features is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop new product offerings, applications, features and enhancements to our existing CRM Platform. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop our platform internally due to certain constraints, such as high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors’ research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could materially adversely affect our business. Changes in the sizes or types of businesses that purchase our platform or in the applications within our CRM Platform purchased or used by our customers could negatively affect our operating results. Our strategy is to sell subscriptions to our CRM Platform to mid-sized businesses, but we have sold and will continue to sell to organizations ranging from small businesses to enterprises. Our gross margins can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our CRM Platform, including the sophistication and intensity of our customers’ use of our platform and the level of professional services and support required by a customer. Sales to enterprise customers may entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts. Selling to small businesses may involve greater credit risk and uncertainty. If there are changes in the mix of businesses that purchase our platform or the mix of the product plans purchased by our customers, our gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected. We have in the past completed acquisitions and may acquire or invest in other companies or technologies in the future, which could divert management’s attention, fail to meet our expectations, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations or harm our operating results. We have in the past acquired, and we may in the future acquire or invest in, businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities, for example, the acquisition of PieSync in 2019. We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these or any future acquisitions. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. There are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to assimilate or integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition and our management may be distracted from operating our business. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including: unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; incurrence of acquisition-related costs, which would be recognized as a current period expense; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our platform and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to integrate or implement additional controls, procedures and policies; challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; harm to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition; the potential loss of key 16 employees; use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business and diversion of management and employee resources; the inability to recognize acquired deferred revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies; and use of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition. Acquisitions also increase the risk of unforeseen legal liability, including for potential violations of applicable law or industry rules and regulations, arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired businesses which are not discovered by due diligence during the acquisition process. Generally, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not ultimately yield expected returns, we may be required to make charges to our operating results based on our impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations. Because our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to customers outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations. A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. We have opened 8 international offices since 2012. We also plan to open additional offices in the future. These international offices focus primarily on sales, professional services and support. We also have a development team in Dublin, Ireland. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including: • difficulties in maintaining our company culture with a dispersed and distant workforce; • more stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws; • differing labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations; • challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs; • difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems; • currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future; • global economic uncertainty caused by global political events, including the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, on January 31, 2020, or ""Brexit"", and similar geopolitical developments; • limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries; • limited or insufficient intellectual property protection; • political instability or terrorist activities; • likelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, or of U.S. and international export control and sanctions regulations, which likelihood may increase with an increase of sales or operations in foreign jurisdictions and operations in certain industries; and • adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash. Our limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will suffer. We continue to implement policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to or arising from our international business. Inadequacies in our past or current compliance practices may increase the risk of inadvertent violations of such laws and regulations, which could lead to financial and other penalties that could damage our reputation and impose costs on us. 17 Risks Related to Employee Matters If we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed. We believe that a critical component to our success has been our company culture, which is based on transparency and personal autonomy. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team within this company culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow as and continue to develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our company culture. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business may be adversely impacted. We rely on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business. Our success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team, including our co-founders, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, and other key employees in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services, content management, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers and information technology personnel because of the complexity of our platform, technologies and infrastructure. We may terminate any employee’s employment at any time, with or without cause, and any employee may resign at any time, with or without cause. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel. The loss of one or more of our key employees could harm our business. The failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy. To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled information technology, marketing, sales and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. Also, inbound sales, marketing, services, and content management domain experts are very important to our success and are difficult to replace. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In particular, we have experienced a competitive hiring environment in the Greater Boston area, where we are headquartered. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed. Risks Related to Our Technical Operations Infrastructure and Dependence on Third Parties Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver our platform to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue. We currently serve the majority of our platform functions from third-party data center hosting facilities operated by Amazon Web Services located in northern Virginia and Google Cloud Platform located in Frankfurt, Germany. In addition, we serve ancillary functions for our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities operated by Rackspace located in Dallas, Texas, with a backup facility in Chicago, Illinois. Our operations depend, in part, on our third-party facility providers’ abilities to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that any of our third-party facilities arrangements is terminated, or if there is a lapse of service or damage to a facility, we could experience interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems of our third-party providers could result in interruptions to our platform. Despite precautions taken at our data centers, the occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, such as earthquakes or hurricane, an act of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close a facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our on-demand software. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause customers to fail to renew their subscriptions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. 18 If our CRM Platform has outages or fails due to defects or similar problems, and if we fail to correct any defect or other software problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs. Our platform and its underlying infrastructure are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. We release modifications, updates, bug fixes and other changes to our software several times per day, without traditional human-performed quality control reviews for each release. We have from time to time found defects in our software and may discover additional defects in the future. We may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before customers begin to use our platform or its applications. Consequently, we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our platform has been implemented. For example, in March 2019, we had a product outage due to the failure of one of the infrastructure systems that supports multiple parts of our platform. Although no data from prior to the outage was lost, our customers experienced disruptions in using our platform during the outage. Defects or errors could result in product outages and could also cause inaccuracies in the data we collect and process for our customers, or even the loss, damage or inadvertent release of such confidential data. We implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regular system maintenance, which may lead to system downtime. Even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any history of product outages, defects or inaccuracies in the data we collect for our customers, or the loss, damage or inadvertent release of confidential data could cause our reputation to be harmed, and customers may elect not to purchase or renew their agreements with us. Furthermore, these issues could subject us to service performance credits (whether offered by us or required by contract), warranty claims or increased insurance costs. The costs associated with product outages, any material defects or errors in our platform or other performance problems may be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, third-party apps and features on our CRM Platform may not meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts and, to the extent they contain bugs, vulnerabilities or defects, they may create disruptions in our customers’ use of our products, lead to data loss, unauthorized access to customer data, damage our brand and reputation and affect the continued use of our products, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are dependent on the continued availability of third-party data hosting and transmission services. A significant portion of our operating cost is from our third-party data hosting and transmission services. If the costs for such services increase due to vendor consolidation, regulation, contract renegotiation, or otherwise, we may not be able to increase the fees for our CRM Platform or services to cover the changes. As a result, our operating results may be significantly worse than forecasted. If we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our CRM Platform with third-party applications that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue will decline. A significant percentage of our customers choose to integrate our platform with certain capabilities provided by third-party application providers using application programming interfaces (“APIs”) published by these providers. The functionality and popularity of our CRM Platform depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our platform with third-party applications and platforms, including CRM, CMS, e-commerce, call center, analytics and social media sites that our customers use and from which they obtain data. Third-party providers of applications and APIs may change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms, or alter the terms governing use of their applications and APIs and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our platform, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our platform with new third-party applications and platforms that our customers use for marketing, sales, services or content management purposes, or fail to renew existing relationships pursuant to which we currently provide such integration, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate new revenue or maintain existing revenue and adversely impact our business. 19 We rely on data provided by third parties, the loss of which could limit the functionality of our platform and disrupt our business. Select functionality of our CRM Platform depends on our ability to deliver data, including search engine results and social media updates, provided by unaffiliated third parties, such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter. Some of this data is provided to us pursuant to third-party data sharing policies and terms of use, under data sharing agreements by third-party providers or by customer consent. In the future, any of these third parties could change its data sharing policies, including making them more restrictive, or alter its algorithms that determine the placement, display, and accessibility of search results and social media updates, any of which could result in the loss of, or significant impairment to, our ability to collect and provide useful data to our customers. These third parties could also interpret our, or our service providers’, data collection policies or practices as being inconsistent with their policies, which could result in the loss of our ability to collect this data for our customers. Any such changes could impair our ability to deliver data to our customers and could adversely impact select functionality of our platform, impairing the return on investment that our customers derive from using our solution, as well as adversely affecting our business and our ability to generate revenue. Privacy concerns and end users’ acceptance of Internet behavior tracking may limit the applicability, use and adoption of our CRM Platform. Privacy concerns may cause end users to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our platform effectively. We have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better protect end user privacy, but these measures may not alleviate all potential privacy concerns and threats. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform, especially in certain industries that rely on sensitive personal information. Privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by these groups’ policies and actions may limit the use and adoption of our CRM Platform and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance or loss of any such action. If our or our customers’ security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to data of our customers or their customers is otherwise obtained, our CRM Platform may be perceived as not being secure, our customers may be harmed and may curtail or cease their use of our platform, our reputation may be damaged and we may incur significant liabilities. Our operations involve the storage and transmission of data of our customers and their customers, including personally identifiable information. Our storage is typically the sole source of record for portions of our customers’ businesses and end user data, such as initial contact information and online interactions. Security incidents could result in unauthorized access to, loss of or unauthorized disclosure of this information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales and harm our customers and our business. Cyber-attacks and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and cloud-based platform providers of marketing services have been targeted. If our security measures are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liability. If third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, violate applicable laws, our security policies or our acceptable use policy, such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if the security measures of our customers are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches to us or our systems. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems or gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data. Additionally, we provide extensive access to our database, which stores our customer data, to our development team to facilitate our rapid pace of product development. If such access or our own operations cause the loss, damage or destruction of our customers’ business data, their sales, lead generation, support and other business operations may be permanently harmed. As a result, our customers may bring claims against us for lost profits and other damages. Our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators, vendors, and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Cyber incidents have been increasing in sophistication and frequency and can include third parties gaining access to employee or customer data using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, ransomware, card skimming code, and other deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. 20 If we were to experience a cyberattack and suffer interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other disruptions. These cyber-attacks could be carried out by threat actors of all types (including but not limited to nation states, organized crime, other criminal enterprises, individual actors and/or advanced persistent threat groups). In addition, we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by any of these threat actors. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our competitive position could be harmed. Any breach, loss, or compromise of personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties, or claims for damages either under the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and relevant member state law in the European Union, other foreign laws, and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the United States. Many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents or unauthorized transfers involving certain types of personal data. In addition, some of our customers contractually require notification of any data security compromise. Security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Risks Related to Intellectual Property Our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others. The software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual and proprietary rights. Companies in the software industry, including those in marketing software, are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents and/or have filed patent applications and may assert patent or other intellectual property rights within the industry. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups that are non-practicing entities, commonly referred to as “patent trolls,” have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements. From time to time, we may receive threatening letters or notices or may be the subject of claims that our services and/or platform and underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand and cause us to incur significant expenses. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to redesign our application, delay releases, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our platform. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our customers may not purchase our CRM Platform if they are concerned that they may infringe third-party intellectual property rights. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. In our subscription agreements with our customers, we generally do not agree to indemnify our customers against any losses or costs incurred in connection with claims by a third party alleging that a customer’s use of our services or platform infringes the intellectual property rights of the third party. There can be no assurance, however, that customers will not assert a common law indemnity claim or that any existing limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate, or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Our customers who are accused of intellectual property infringement may in the future seek indemnification from us under common law or other legal theories. If such claims are successful, or if we are required to indemnify or defend our customers from these or other claims, these matters could be disruptive to our business and management and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 21 If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, in the United States and abroad, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, experience reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights. Our success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our offerings may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our technology and proprietary information may increase. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform and offerings. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform and offerings, impair the functionality of our platform and offerings, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform and offerings, or injure our reputation. Our use of “open source” software could negatively affect our ability to offer our platform and subject us to possible litigation. A substantial portion of our cloud-based platform incorporates so-called “open source” software, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Open source software is generally freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source licenses may, in certain circumstances, require us to offer the components of our platform that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from the offering of the components of our platform that contained the open source software and being required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt our ability to offer the affected software. We could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. Risks Related to Government Regulation We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various state, local and foreign agencies. We collect personally identifiable information and other data from our customers and leads. We also handle personally identifiable information about our customers’ customers. We use this information to provide services to our customers, to support, expand and improve our business. We may also share customers’ personally identifiable information with third parties as authorized by the customer or as described in our privacy policy. The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying 22 federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use and dissemination of data. However, these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security are evolving, and changes to such laws and regulations could require us to change features of our platform or restrict our customers’ ability to collect and use email addresses, page viewing data and personal information, which may reduce demand for our platform. Our failure to comply with federal, state and international data privacy laws and regulations could harm our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that, among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA recently was amended and it is not yet fully clear how the CCPA will be enforced and how certain of its requirements will be interpreted. We cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed in November 2020. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The effects of the CCPA and the CPRA are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation. Certain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations and we also expect anticipate that more states to may enact legislation similar to the CCPA, which provides consumers with new privacy rights and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information of such consumers. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. In addition, several foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada, have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents, which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual. In relevant part, these laws and regulations may affect our ability to engage in lead generation activities by imposing heightened requirements, such as affirmative opt-ins or consent prior to sending commercial correspondence or engaging in electronic tracking activities. For example, a recent ruling of the European Court of Justice in Case C-673/17 provides that a pre-checked opt-in is insufficient to constitute a valid active consumer consent to cookie storage. Within the European Union, legislators have adopted the GDPR and which became effective in May 2018 which may impose additional obligations and risk upon our business and which may increase substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. In addition, further to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain United Kingdom specific amendments) into United Kingdom law (the “UK GDPR”). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The United Kingdom, however, is now regarded as a third country under the European Union’s GDPR which means that transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area to the United Kingdom will be restricted unless an appropriate safeguard, as recognized by the European Union’s GDPR, has been put in place. However, under the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement it is lawful to transfer personal data between the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area for a 6 month period following the end of the transition period, with a view to achieving an adequacy decision from the European Commission during that period. Like the European Union GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the United Kingdom to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection (this means that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the European Economic Area remain free flowing). On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted the EU-US Privacy Shield, a framework for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States, as a successor to the Safe Harbor framework that was invalidated by the European Court of Justice in October 2015. We certified to the EU-US Privacy Shield. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice 23 invalidated the EU–US Privacy Shield ruling that it failed to offer adequate protections for European Union personal data transferred to the United States. The European Court of Justice, in the same decision, deemed that the Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal data between European Union controllers and non-European Union processors are valid, however the European Court of Justice deemed that transfers made pursuant to the SCCs need to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis to ensure the European Union’s standards of data protection are met. Our customer agreements include SCCs. However, as a result of this decision, companies may be required to adopt additional measures to accomplish transfers of personal data to the United States and other third countries in compliance with the GDPR, and there continue to be concerns about whether the SCCs will face additional challenges. Until the remaining legal uncertainties regarding how to legally continue these transfers are settled, we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our customers will be permitted to transfer personal data to the United States for processing by us as part of our platform services. If such data transfer to the United States is not permitted, it could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new customers. Our customers may view alternative data transfer mechanisms as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. For example, some of our customers or potential customers who do business in the European Union may require their vendors to host all personal data within the European Union and may decide to do business with one of our competitors who hosts personal data within the European Union instead of doing business with us. The regulatory framework governing the collection, processing, storage, use and sharing of certain information, particularly financial and other personal information, is rapidly evolving and is likely to continue to be subject to uncertainty and varying interpretations. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or any third parties with which we do business, to comply with our posted privacy policies, changing consumer expectations, evolving laws, rules and regulations, industry standards, or contractual obligations to which we or such third parties are or may become subject, may result in actions or other claims against us by governmental entities or private actors, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources or the incurrence of significant fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, any such action, particularly to the extent we were found to be guilty of violations or otherwise liable for damages, would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We publicly post documentation regarding our practices concerning the collection, processing, use and disclosure of data. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or any applicable privacy, security or data protection, information security or consumer-protection related laws, regulations, orders or industry standards could expose us to costly litigation, significant awards, fines or judgments, civil and/or criminal penalties or negative publicity, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The publication of our privacy policy and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, which could, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to claims, legal proceedings or other actions by individuals or governmental authorities based on privacy or data protection regulations and our commitments to customers or others, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our subscribers’ ability to use and share personal information or our ability to store, process and share personal information, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. We could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of the activities of our customers, the content of their websites or the data they store on our servers. As a provider of a cloud-based inbound marketing, sales and customer service software platform, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with the data they store on our servers. Although our customer terms of use prohibit illegal use of our services by our customers and permit us to take down websites or take other appropriate actions for illegal use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law or the customer’s own policies, which could subject us to liability or harm our reputation. Furthermore, customers may upload, store, or use content on our CRM Platform that may violate our policy on acceptable use which prohibits content that is threatening, abusive, harassing, deceptive, false, misleading, vulgar, obscene, or indecent. While such content may not be illegal, use of our CRM Platform for such content could harm our reputation resulting in a loss of business. Several U.S. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to various customer activities: • The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, or DMCA, provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet. Under the DMCA, based on our 24 current business activity as an Internet service provider that does not own or control website content posted by our customers, we generally are not liable for infringing content posted by our customers or other third parties, provided that we follow the procedures for handling copyright infringement claims set forth in the DMCA. Generally, if we receive a proper notice from, or on behalf, of a copyright owner alleging infringement of copyrighted material located on websites we host, and we fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the safe harbor provided by the DMCA, the copyright owner may seek to impose liability on us. Technical mistakes in complying with the detailed DMCA take-down procedures could subject us to liability for copyright infringement. • The Communications Decency Act of 1996, or CDA, generally protects online service providers, such as us, from liability for certain activities of their customers, such as the posting of defamatory or obscene content, unless the online service provider is participating in the unlawful conduct. Under the CDA, we are generally not responsible for the customer-created content hosted on our servers. Consequently, we do not monitor hosted websites or prescreen the content placed by our customers on their sites. However, the CDA does not apply in foreign jurisdictions and we may nonetheless be brought into disputes between our customers and third parties which would require us to devote management time and resources to resolve such matters and any publicity from such matters could also have an adverse effect on our reputation and therefore our business. • In addition to the CDA, the Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act, or the SPEECH Act, provides a statutory exception to the enforcement by a U.S. court of a foreign judgment for defamation under certain circumstances. Generally, the exception applies if the defamation law applied in the foreign court did not provide at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press as would be provided by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or by the constitution and law of the state in which the U.S. court is located, or if no finding of defamation would be supported under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or under the constitution and law of the state in which the U.S. court is located. Although the SPEECH Act may protect us from the enforcement of foreign judgments in the United States, it does not affect the enforceability of the judgment in the foreign country that issued the judgment. Given our international presence, we may therefore, nonetheless, have to defend against or comply with any foreign judgments made against us, which could take up substantial management time and resources and damage our reputation. Although these statutes and case law in the United States have generally shielded us from liability for customer activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. In addition, laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible for us to comply with in some international jurisdictions. Also, notwithstanding the exculpatory language of these bodies of law, we may become involved in complaints and lawsuits which, even if ultimately resolved in our favor, add cost to our doing business and may divert management’s time and attention. Finally, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various states, may be deemed to apply or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future, any of which could expose us to further liability and increase our costs of doing business. The standards that private entities use to regulate the use of email have in the past interfered with, and may in the future interfere with, the effectiveness of our CRM Platform and our ability to conduct business. Our customers rely on email to communicate with their existing or prospective customers. Various private entities attempt to regulate the use of email for commercial solicitation. These entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain email solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as spam. Some of these entities maintain “blacklists” of companies and individuals, and the websites, internet service providers and internet protocol addresses associated with those entities or individuals that do not adhere to those standards of conduct or practices for commercial email solicitations that the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate. If a company’s internet protocol addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity, emails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any internet domain or internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity’s service or purchases its blacklist. From time to time, some of our internet protocol addresses may become listed with one or more blacklisting entities due to the messaging practices of our customers. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully remove ourselves from those lists. Blacklisting of this type could interfere with our ability to market our CRM Platform and services and communicate with our customers and, because we fulfill email delivery on behalf of our customers, could undermine the effectiveness of our customers’ email marketing campaigns, all of which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations. 25 Existing federal, state and foreign laws regulate Internet tracking software, the senders of commercial emails and text messages, website owners and other activities, and could impact the use of our CRM Platform and potentially subject us to regulatory enforcement or private litigation. Certain aspects of how our customers utilize our platform are subject to regulations in the United States, European Union and elsewhere. In recent years, U.S. and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over the use of third-party cookies or web beacons for online behavioral advertising, and legislation adopted recently in the European Union requires informed consent for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device. Regulation of cookies and web beacons may lead to restrictions on our activities, such as efforts to understand users’ Internet usage. New and expanding “Do Not Track” regulations have recently been enacted or proposed that protect users’ right to choose whether or not to be tracked online. These regulations seek, among other things, to allow end users to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with their choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third party websites. These policies could have a significant impact on the operation of our CRM Platform and could impair our attractiveness to customers, which would harm our business. Many of our customers and potential customers in the healthcare, financial services and other industries are subject to substantial regulation regarding their collection, use and protection of data and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. Accordingly, these laws or significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and may require us to implement additional features or offer additional contractual terms to satisfy customer and regulatory requirements, or could cause the demand for and sales of our CRM Platform to decrease and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act, establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. The CAN-SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender. The ability of our customers’ message recipients to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of the email components of our CRM Platform. In addition, certain states and foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada and the European Union, have enacted laws that regulate sending email, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending unsolicited email unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such email, or in other words has “opted-in” to receiving it. A requirement that recipients opt into, or the ability of recipients to opt out of, receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our platform. While these laws and regulations generally govern our customers’ use of our platform, we may be subject to certain laws as a data processor on behalf of, or as a business associate of, our customers. For example, laws and regulations governing the collection, use and disclosure of personal information include, in the United States, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and state breach notification laws, and internationally, the Data Protection Directive in the European Union and the Federal Data Protection Act in Germany. If we were found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations as a result of government enforcement or private litigation, we could be subjected to civil and criminal sanctions, including both monetary fines and injunctive action that could force us to change our business practices, all of which could adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our reputation and our business. We are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Our business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and reputational harm. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit certain transactions with U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. Although we take precautions to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets, the possibility exists that we could inadvertently provide our solutions to persons prohibited by U.S. sanctions. This could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Risks Related to Taxation 26 We may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, which could harm our business. State, local and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added, Digital Services Tax, and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of such taxes to our CRM Platform in various jurisdictions is unclear. Further, these jurisdictions’ rules regarding tax nexus are complex and vary significantly. As a result, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits, and our liability for these taxes and associated penalties could exceed our original estimates. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, value added or other taxes in those jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our application or otherwise harm our business and operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers could increase the costs of our CRM Platform and adversely impact our business. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. If we raise our prices to offset the costs of these changes, existing and potential future customers may elect not to continue or purchase our CRM Platform in the future. Additionally, new, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers’ and our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our platform. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance. We are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions. As a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. Changes in tax laws, such as tax reform in the United States or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting,” could impact our effective tax rate. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations. We may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability. We have incurred losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and we may never achieve profitability. As of December 31, 2020, we had $760 million of U.S. federal and $508 million state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which, if not utilized, some of which will begin to expire in 2027 for federal purposes and begin to expire in 2023 for state purposes. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. Our U.S federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards incurred for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 would not expire unused because they can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be further limited if we experience an “ownership change”. An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced an ownership change in the past, and future issuances of our stock could cause an ownership change. It is possible that any such ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes accrued prior to such ownership change, which could adversely affect our profitability. 27 Risks Related to Our Operating Results and Financial Condition We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future. We generated net losses of $85.0 million in 2020, $53.7 million in 2019, and $63.8 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $483.2 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to grow our marketing, sales, customer service, and content management operations, develop and enhance our CRM Platform, scale our data center infrastructure and services capabilities and expand into new markets. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease. From time to time, we may invest funds in social impact investment funds, and may receive no return on our investment or lose our entire investment. From time to time, we may invest in social impact investment funds. For example, in December 2020, we committed $20 million to social impact investing. Our first allocation of those funds was a $12.5 million investment in the Black Economic Development Fund (“BEDF”). The BEDF is managed by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (“LISC”), which expects to make investments from the BEDF in the form of bank deposits, bridge financing, and other financing to Black-led businesses, financial institutions, and anchor institutions. There is no guarantee as to the performance of this investment or any similar investments we make in the future. Depending on the performance of this investment and future investments we may make, we may not receive any return on our investment or we may lose our entire investment, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following: • changes in spending on marketing, sales and customer service software by our current or prospective customers; • pricing our CRM Platform subscriptions effectively so that we are able to attract and retain customers without compromising our profitability; • attracting new customers for our marketing, sales, customer service, and content management software, increasing our existing customers’ use of our platform and providing our customers with excellent customer support; • customer renewal rates and the amounts for which agreements are renewed; • global awareness of our thought leadership and brand; • changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers and the introduction of new products or product enhancements; • changes to the commission plans, quotas and other compensation-related metrics for our sales representatives; • the amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development, sales and marketing expenses and employee benefit expenses; • the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees while maintaining our company culture; • our ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including increases in the number of customers on our platform and the introduction and adoption of our CRM Platform in new markets outside of the United States; • unforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure, including disruptions in our hosting network infrastructure and privacy and data security; • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and • general economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets. 28 We may not be able to accurately forecast the amount and mix of future subscriptions, revenue and expenses and, as a result, our operating results may fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, or below any guidance we may provide, the price of our common stock could decline. If we do not accurately predict subscription renewal rates or otherwise fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. Because our recent growth has resulted in the rapid expansion of our business, we do not have a long history upon which to base forecasts of renewal rates with customers or future operating revenue. As a result, our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market, equity research analysts or investors, which could harm the price of our common stock. Because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the agreement, near term changes in sales may not be reflected immediately in our operating results. We offer our CRM Platform primarily through a mix of monthly, quarterly and single-year subscription agreements and generally recognize revenue ratably over the related subscription period. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from agreements entered into during prior months, quarters or years. In addition, we do not record deferred revenue beyond amounts invoiced as a liability on our balance sheet. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions or marketing solutions agreements in any one quarter is not likely to be reflected immediately in our revenue results for that quarter. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenue and deferred revenue balances in future periods, and the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenue and deferred revenue balance through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Risks Related to Our Notes Servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We incurred indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million in connection with the issuance of our 0.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). In June 2020, the Company exchanged approximately $272.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes in privately-negotiated transactions for an aggregate of approximately $283.0 million in cash and 1.6 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, $125.8 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2022 Notes. In June 2020, concurrent with the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes, we incurred indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $460.0 million in connection with the issuance of our 0.375% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and together with the 2022 Notes (the “Notes”). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt. In addition, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. 29 If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. In addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could: • make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; • place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and • limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase. The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 Notes or the 2025 Notes is triggered, the holders thereof will be entitled to convert the 2022 Notes or the 2025 Notes respectively, at any time during specified periods at their option. Because the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company settled $2 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash. Between the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and February 12, 2021, the Company additionally settled $8.3 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash in response to conversion notices received prior to December 31, 2020. As of February 12, 2021, the Company has received additional conversion notices subsequent to year-end for approximately $36.1 million of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes, which will be settled in cash during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Because the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2025 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. As of February 12, 2021, no holders have converted or indicated their intention to convert the 2025 Notes. Whether the Notes that remain outstanding will be convertible following the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2020 will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or another conversion condition in the future. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. The Notes are currently classified as long-term debt, except for $7.8 million, classified as current as of December 31, 2020, for conversion notices received prior to year-end, for which the principal amount, net of discount, is expected to be cash-settled within the next fiscal quarter. The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion option of the Notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheet and as a discount to the Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the Notes, net of the discount recorded, will be accreted up to the principal amount of the Notes from the issuance date until maturity, which will result in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we will report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period’s accretion of the debt discount and the instrument’s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. 30 In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. In August 2020, the FASB issued guidance simplifying ASC 470-20 by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Under the new guidance, we will no longer be required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. This will have the impact of reducing non-cash interest expense, and thereby increasing net income (or decreasing net losses). Additionally, the new guidance eliminates the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires use of the “if-converted” method, which would decrease (increase) our diluted net income (loss) per share. The new standard is effective beginning in January 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price may be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you purchased them. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies, including providers of software via the cloud-based model, have been highly volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in October 2014 at a price of $25.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $25.79 to $420.61, through December 31, 2020. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results, including as a result of the addition or loss of any number of customers; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; • the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; • failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in ratings and financial estimates and the publication of other news by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; • changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of cloud-based software or other technology companies, or those in our industry in particular; • price and volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock and in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; • sales of large blocks of our common stock or the dilutive effect of our Notes or any other equity or equity-linked financings; • new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or industry, including data privacy and data security; • lawsuits threatened or filed against us; • changes in key personnel; and • other events or factors, including changes in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business. 31 If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. As a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. We expect that compliance with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Furthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these requirements effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that: • authorize “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; • provide for a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms; • specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer or the president; • prohibit stockholder action by written consent; • establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; • provide that our directors may be removed only for cause; • provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; • specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; • authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and • require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. 32 In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us in certain circumstances. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. General Risks Failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business. Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. As we have expanded our international operations our exposure exchange rate fluctuations has increased, in particular with respect to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Australian Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen and Colombian Peso. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results, when re-measured, may differ materially from expectations. In addition, our operating results are subject to fluctuation if our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions and expenses changes in the future. Furthermore, global political events, including Brexit and similar geopolitical developments, fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments, have caused global economic uncertainty, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to predict our future results and earnings accurately. Although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. Additionally, as we anticipate growing our business further outside of the United States, the effects of movements in currency exchange rates will increase as our transaction volume outside of the United States increases. Weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. Global financial developments and downturns seemingly unrelated to us or the software industry may harm us. The United States and other key international economies have been affected from time to time by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy, including with respect to tariff and trade issues. In particular, the economies of countries in Europe have been experiencing weakness associated with high sovereign debt levels, weakness in the banking sector, uncertainty over the future of the Euro zone and volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the Euro, including instability surrounding Brexit. We have operations, as well as current and potential new customers, throughout most of Europe. If economic conditions in Europe and other key markets for our platform continue to remain uncertain or deteriorate further, it could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to subscribe to our platform, delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions or affect renewal rates, all of which could harm our operating results. Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing. Our business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds to invest in future growth opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. The Notes are and any additional equity or equity-linked financings would be dilutive to our stockholders. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond 33 our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. Properties We occupy approximately 443,000 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts pursuant to lease agreements that expire through 2029. We also maintain offices in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Dublin, Ireland, Sydney, Australia, Singapore, Tokyo, Japan, Berlin, Germany, Bogotá, Colombia, Paris, France, and Ghent, Belgium. We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs. We intend to add new facilities or expand existing facilities as we add employees, and we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any such expansion of our operations. ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the ultimate costs to resolve any pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not Applicable. 34 PART II ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information for Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HUBS” since October 9, 2014. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our common stock. Our initial public offering was priced at $25.00 per share on October 8, 2014. As of February 12, 2021, we had 27 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of shareholders is greater than this number of record holders, and includes shareholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include shareholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities. Dividends We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings to fund development and growth of our business, and do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be, subject to applicable law, at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and capital requirements.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers None. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans See Item 12, “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters,” for information regarding securities authorized for issuance. Outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, Convertible Note Hedge, and Warrant In May 2017, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the “2022 Notes”) due June 1, 2022, of which $272.1 million was repurchased in June 2020 and $2 million was settled in cash during the fourth quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $125.8 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2022 Notes. Also in June 2020, we issued $460 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due June 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, the Company purchased capped call options (“Capped Call Options”) that give the Company the option to purchase up to approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $282.52 per share. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Convertible Note Hedges”) with certain counterparties in which the Company has the option to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of approximately $94.77 per share. In addition, the Company sold warrants (the “Warrants”) to certain bank counterparties whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $115.8 per share. As of December 31, 2020, Convertible Note Hedges corresponding to approximately 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock and Warrants corresponding to approximately 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock remain outstanding.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Company Overview We provide a cloud-based customer relationship management (“CRM”) Platform. Our CRM Platform is comprised of Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub and content management system (“CMS”) Hub as well as other tools and integrations that enable companies to attract, engage, and delight customers throughout the customer experience. At the core of our CRM Platform is our CRM that our customers use which creates a single view of all interactions a prospective or existing customer has with their marketing, sales and customer service teams. The CRM shares data across every application in the CRM Platform, automatically informing more personalized emails, website content, ads, and conversations, and enables more accurate timing cues for our customer’s internal teams. In addition, the CRM Platform was built to easily and seamlessly integrate third party applications to further customize to an individual company’s industry or needs. We designed and built our CRM Platform to serve a broad range of customers globally. Our CRM Platform starts completely free and grows with our customers to meet their needs at different stages in their life-cycles. It supports multiple languages and currencies and offers an array of sophisticated features, including content partitioning at the enterprise level for companies operating in or serving multiple countries. We focus on selling to mid-market business-to-business, or B2B, companies, which we define as companies that have between two and 2,000 employees. While our CRM Platform was built to grow with any company, we focus on selling to mid-market businesses because we believe we have significant competitive advantages attracting and serving this market segment. These mid-market businesses seek an integrated, easy-to-implement and easy-to-use solution to reach customers and compete with organizations that have larger marketing, sales, and customer service budgets. We efficiently reach these businesses at scale through our proven inbound methodology, our Solutions Partners, and our “freemium” model. A Solutions Partner is a service provider that helps businesses with strategy, execution, and implementation of go-to-market activities and technology solutions. Our freemium model attracts customers who begin using our CRM Platform through our free products and then upgrade to our paid products. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,225 full-time employees and 103,994 Total Customers of varying sizes in more than 120 countries, representing almost every industry. Our CRM Platform is a multi-tenant, single code-based and globally available software-as-a-service product delivered through web browsers or mobile applications. We sell our CRM Platform on a subscription basis. Our total revenue increased to $883.0 million in 2020, from $674.9 million in 2019, and from $513.0 million in 2018, representing year-over-year increases of 31% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. We had net losses of $85.0 million in 2020, $53.7 million in 2019, and $63.8 million in 2018, primarily due to investments in our growth. We derive most of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based CRM Platform and related professional services, which consist of customer on-boarding and training services. Subscription revenue accounted for 97% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 96% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 95% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We sell multiple product plans at different base prices on a subscription basis, each of which includes our CRM and integrated applications to meet the needs of the various customers we serve. Customers pay additional fees if the number of contacts stored and tracked in the customer’s database exceeds specified thresholds. We also generate additional revenue based on the purchase of additional subscriptions and products, and the number of account users and subdomains. Most of our customers’ subscriptions are one year or less in duration. Subscriptions are billed in advance on various schedules. Because the mix of billing terms for orders can vary from period to period, the annualized value of the orders we enter into with our customers will not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that change in deferred revenue is an accurate indicator of future revenue. Many of our customers purchase on-boarding and training services which are designed to help customers enhance their ability to attract, engage and delight their customers using our CRM Platform. Professional services and other revenue accounted for 3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect professional services and other margins to range from a moderate loss to breakeven for the foreseeable future. 39 COVID-19 Update In March 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a pandemic (the “pandemic”). This pandemic is having widespread, rapidly-evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential businesses, quarantines, work-from-home directives, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on public gatherings. These measurements have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers, and ensuring business continuity. In March 2020, we temporarily closed our global offices, including our corporate headquarters, suspended all company-related travel, and all HubSpot employees globally were required to work from home. We shifted our Solutions Partner events and INBOUND 2020 to virtual-only experiences and have cancelled other customer and industry events. During the third quarter of 2020, we began to slowly re-open our offices on a staggered, region-to-region basis in accordance with local authority guidelines while ensuring that our return to work was thoughtful, prudent, and handled with an abundance of caution with the health of our employees being the top priority. During the fourth quarter of 2020, due to surges in COVID-19 cases at almost all of our office locations, we elected to close all of our global offices. We are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic and will continue to be thoughtful about employee safety and well-being. Given that the economic consequences of the pandemic have been exceptionally challenging for many of our customers and prospects, we also implemented certain changes to our pricing structure in March 2020, including reducing prices on our Starter Growth Suite, offering certain product functionality free of charge for a limited time, suspending marketing email send limits for a limited time, and offering a one-time six-month advance on commissions to certain of our Solutions Partners. While the pandemic has not had a material adverse financial impact on our business to date, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance will depend on future developments and conditions. The pandemic and its adverse effects are prevalent in the locations where we, our customers, and partners conduct business. As a result, at the outset of the pandemic, we experienced, and may again experience in the future, curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. Specifically, we may be impacted by changes in our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our offerings; changes in the timing of our current or prospective customers’ purchasing decisions; pricing discounts or extended payment terms; reductions in the amount or duration of customers’ subscription contracts; or increased customer attrition rates. While our revenue, customer retention, and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the effect of the pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. While the implications of the pandemic remain uncertain, we plan to continue to make investments to support business growth. We believe that the growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to expand our customer base, increase adoption of our CRM Platform within existing customers, develop new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform and provide a high level of customer service. We expect to invest in sales and marketing to support customer growth. We also expect to invest in research and development as we continue to introduce new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform. We also intend to maintain a high level of customer service and support which we consider critical for our continued success. We plan to continue to invest in our data center infrastructure and services capabilities in order to support continued customer growth. We also expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses to support our business and to maintain the infrastructure required to be a public company. We expect to use our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our convertible debt and stock offerings to fund these growth strategies and support our business despite the potential impact from the pandemic and do not expect to be profitable in the near term. 40 Key Business Metrics The following key business metrics are presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our press releases announcing our financial results which are furnished on Form 8-K. We use these key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and results of operations, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. These key business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar key business metrics used by other companies. Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Total Customers 103,994 73,483 56,628 Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer $ 9,582 $ 9,920 9,904 Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate 102.3 % 99.9 % 100.7 % Total Customers. We believe that our ability to increase our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and growth of our business as we continue to expand our sales force and invest in marketing efforts. We define our Total Customers at the end of a particular period as the number of business entities or individuals with one or more paid subscriptions to our CRM Platform either paid directly or through a Solutions Partner. We do not include in Total Customers business entities or individuals with one or more paid subscriptions solely for our legacy Sales Hub ($10) product or any PieSync product. A single customer may have separate paid subscriptions for separate websites, sales licenses or seats, or our Sales Hub, Marketing Hub, Service Hub, or CMS Hub products, but we count these as one customer if certain customer-provided information such as company name, URL, or email address indicate that these subscriptions are managed by the same business entity or individual. Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer. We believe that our ability to increase the Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer is an indicator of our ability to grow the long-term value of our existing customer relationships. We define Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer during a particular period as subscription revenue, excluding revenue from our legacy Sales Hub ($10) and PieSync products, from our Total Customers during the period divided by the average Total Customers during the same period. Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate. We believe that our ability to retain and expand a customer relationship is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customers. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate. We compare the aggregate Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue of our Total Customer base as of the beginning of each month, which we refer to as Total Retention Base Revenue, to the aggregate Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue of the same group of Total Customers at the end of that month, which we refer to as Total Retained Subscription Revenue. We define Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue as the total amount of subscription fees contractually committed to be paid for a full month under all of our Total Customer agreements, excluding any commissions owed to our Solutions Partners. Our Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate for a given period is calculated by first dividing Total Retained Subscription Revenue by Total Retention Base Revenue for each month in the period, calculating the weighted average of these rates using the Total Retention Base Revenue for each month in the period, and then annualizing the resulting rates. Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations Revenue We derive our revenue from two major sources, revenue from subscriptions to our CRM Platform and professional services and other revenue consisting mainly of on-boarding and training services fees. Subscription based revenue is derived from customers using our CRM Platform for their inbound marketing, sales, service, and content management needs. Our CRM Platform features integrated applications that create a cohesive and adaptable customer experience. These integrated applications include a CRM, search engine optimization, blogging, website content management, messaging, chatbots, social media, marketing automation, email, predictive lead scoring, sales productivity, ticketing and helpdesk tools, customer NPS surveys, analytics, and reporting. Subscriptions are billed in advance on various schedules. All subscription fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Subscription based revenue is recognized net of consideration paid to Solutions Partners when those Partners purchase a subscription to our CRM Platform. Professional services and other revenue are derived primarily from customer on-boarding and training services. The on-boarding and training services provided to customers typically involves an implementation specialist. An implementation specialist will typically work with our customers to enhance their understanding of how to attract leads and convert them into customers through search engine optimization, social media, blogging and other content. Training is generally sold in connection with a customer’s initial 41 subscription and is billed in advance. The training is also available to be purchased separately following a customer’s purchase of its initial subscription and our Solutions Partners routinely provide the same training to customers. The Company recognizes revenue from on-boarding and training services as the services are provided. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, employee-related costs including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our customer support team, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs, which we define as rent, facilities, depreciation of fixed assets, and costs related to information technology. Cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel costs of our professional services organization, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platform, as well as allocated overhead costs. We expect that cost of subscription and professional services and other revenue will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing our business. Over time, we expect to gain benefits of scale associated with our costs of hosting our CRM Platform relative to subscription revenues, resulting in improved subscription gross margin, exclusive of stock-based compensation. We expect professional services and other margins to range from a moderate loss to breakeven for the foreseeable future, exclusive of stock-based compensation. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new products and adding incremental functionality to our CRM Platform and amortize such costs as costs of subscription revenue over the estimated life of the new product or incremental functionality, which is generally two years. We also capitalize certain development costs that are attributable to developing our internally developed software platforms and amortize such costs throughout the consolidated statement of operations over the estimated life of our internally developed software platforms, which is generally five years. We focus our research and development efforts on improving our products and developing new ones, delivering new functionality and enhancing the customer experience. We believe delivering new functionality for our customers is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to a broad array of options and information critical to their marketing, sales, and customer service efforts. We expect to continue to make investments in and expand our offerings to enhance our customers’ experience and satisfaction and attract new customers. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase the functionality of our CRM Platform. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual INBOUND conference, other brand building expenses, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platforms, and allocated overhead costs. We defer certain sales commissions related to acquiring new contracts and amortize them ratably over a period of benefit that we have determined to be approximately one to three years. Sales and marketing expenses also include commissions paid to our Solutions Partners in instances where the end customer purchases and pays for a subscription to our CRM Platform. We plan to continue to expand sales and marketing to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. This growth will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to generate additional leads and build brand awareness. We expect sales and marketing expenses will increase as a result of hiring net new quota-carrying sales representatives in the United States and worldwide and adding to our marketing staff. Over time, we expect sales and marketing expenses will decline as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, employee-related information technology, administrative personnel, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platforms, and allocated overhead costs. We expect that 42 general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis but decrease as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation expense, as we focus on processes, systems and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business. We also anticipate continuing increases to general and administrative expenses as we incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including audit and consulting fees. Other Expense Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash and cash equivalents balances and investments. Interest expense primarily consists of amortization of the debt discount, issuance costs and contractual interest expense related to our Notes, and the loss on early extinguishment of our 2022 Notes. Other expense primarily consists of the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities. Income Tax Expense The income tax expense consists of current and deferred taxes for U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We have historically had a taxable loss in our most significant jurisdiction, the U.S., and a full valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets. We expect this to continue in the near term. Results of Operations The following tables set forth certain consolidated financial data in dollar amounts and as a percentage of total revenue.

Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer decreased from $9,920 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $9,582 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth in Total Customers was primarily driven by our increased sales representative capacity to meet market demand as well as our freemium product offering and lower priced starer products. The decrease in average subscription revenue per customer was driven primarily by the volume of continued purchases of our lower priced starter products. The 5% increase in professional services and other revenue resulted primarily from the increase in Total Customers and from the delivery of on-boarding services for the additional subscriptions sold, slightly offset by fewer classroom trainings being held due to social gathering restrictions and travel bans implemented due to the pandemic. Year Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount % (dollars in thousands) Total cost of revenue $ 166,959 $ 129,958 $ 37,001 28 % Gross profit 716,067 544,902 171,165 31 % Gross margin 81 % 81 % 44 Total cost of revenue increased 28% during 2020 primarily due to an increase in subscription and hosting costs, employee-related costs, amortization of capitalized software development costs, and allocated overheard expenses, offset by a decrease in amortization of acquired technology due to certain acquired technology reaching the end of its useful life during the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross margin remained consistent year-over-year.

Additionally, we saw higher subscription and hosting costs as we focus on the security, reliability and performance of our CRM Platform. Employee-related costs increased as a result of increased headcount as we continue to grow our customer support organization to support our customer growth and improve service levels and offerings, offset slightly by reduced discretionary spending as a result of the pandemic. Amortization of capitalized software development costs increased due to the increased number of developers working on our software platform as we continue to develop new products and increased functionality. Allocated overhead expenses increased due to the expansion of our leased space and infrastructure as we continued to grow our business and expand headcount. Amortization of acquired technology decreased due to certain acquired technology reaching the end of its useful life during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Interest expense primarily consists of amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs and contractual interest expense related to our Notes, and the loss on early extinguishment of our 2022 Notes. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the $10.5 million loss on the early extinguishment of our 2022 Notes and amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes. Other expense primarily consists of the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities.

The increase in 47 average subscription revenue per customer was driven primarily by existing customers increasing their use of our products, existing customers purchasing additional subscriptions, and new customers purchasing our higher price product plans. The increase in average subscription revenue per customer was partially offset by the continued adoption of our freemium model. The 12% increase in professional services and other revenue resulted primarily from the increase in Total Customers and from delivery of on-boarding and training services for the additional subscriptions sold.

The increase was primarily due to the use of the effective-interest method to amortize the debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 Notes. Other expense primarily consists of the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities. The decrease was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations. Income Tax Expense Year Ended December 31, Change 2019 2018 Amount % (dollars in thousands) Income tax expense $ (2,973 ) $ (1,868 ) $ (1,105 ) 59 % Effective tax rate 6 % 3 % 50 Income tax expense consists of current and deferred taxes for U.S. and foreign income taxes. The increase in the income tax expense was primarily driven by increased income in jurisdictions outside of the United States that are profitable from a tax perspective. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity to date have been cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, our common stock offerings, and our convertible notes offerings. The following table shows cash and cash equivalents, working capital, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities, net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities, and net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 378,123 $ 269,670 $ 111,489 Working capital 1,011,420 787,235 475,409 Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities 88,913 118,973 84,851 Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities (215,567 ) (316,194 ) (71,230 ) Net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities 222,460 359,342 12,778 Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 was held for working capital purposes. We believe our working capital is sufficient to support our operations for at least the next 12 months. At December 31, 2020, $83.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in accounts outside the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we no longer assert indefinite reinvestment of our foreign earnings because these earnings have been subject to U.S. Federal tax. While we have concluded that any incremental tax incurred upon ultimate distribution of these earnings to be immaterial, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations. Net Cash and Cash Equivalents Provided by Operating Activities Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities consists primarily of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges, net. Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected our net loss of $85.0 million, the portion of the repayment of the 2022 Notes attributable to the debt discount of $49.0 million, benefit for deferred income taxes of $2.2 million and accretion of bond discounts of $3.7 million, offset by non-cash expenses that included $37.1 million of depreciation and amortization, $121.5 million in stock-based compensation, $10.5 million of loss on early extinguishment of 2022 Notes and $24.9 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Working capital sources of cash and cash equivalents primarily included a $72.6 million increase in deferred revenue primarily resulting from the growth in the number of customers invoiced during the period, a $26.0 million increase in accrued expenses, a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable related to timing of bill payments, and a $31.4 million increase in right-of-use asset. These sources of cash and cash equivalents were offset by a $31.6 million decrease in lease liabilities, a $30.0 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business, $19.3 million increase in deferred commissions and a $17.0 million increase in prepaid and other assets. Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected our net loss of $53.7 million and accretion of bond discount of $14.2 million offset by non-cash expenses that included $28.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $97.8 million in stock-based compensation, and $21.8 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Working capital sources of cash and cash equivalents primarily included a $49.3 million increase in deferred revenue primarily resulting from the growth in the number of customers invoiced during the period, a $7.8 million increase in accrued expenses, a $3.9 million increase in accounts payable related to timing of bill payments, and a $22.7 million increase in right-of-use asset. These sources of cash and cash equivalents were offset by a $15.8 million decrease in lease liabilities, a $15.4 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business, $9.7 million increase in deferred commissions and a $3.3 million increase in prepaid and other assets. 51 Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected our net loss of $63.8 million and accretion of bond discount of $6.8 million offset by non-cash expenses that included $23.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $76.3 million in stock-based compensation, $2.3 million of non-cash rent expense and $20.3 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.

These sources of cash and cash equivalents were offset by a $17.7 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business, and a $23.9 million increase in deferred commissions. Net Cash and Cash Equivalents Used in Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases, maturities and sale of investments, property and equipment purchases, an acquisition of a business, strategic investments, and capitalization of software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are related to new products or improvements to our existing software platform that expands the functionality for our customers. Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of $1.5 billion in purchases of investments, $37.3 million of purchased property and equipment, $2.5 million of purchases of strategic investments, and $21.6 million of capitalized software development costs. These uses of cash were offset by $1.4 billion received related to the maturity of investments and $10.9 million received for sale of investments. Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of $1.3 billion of purchases of investments, $40.4 million of purchased property and equipment, $13.5 million of capitalized software development costs, a $23.3 million business acquisition and $0.6 million related to the purchase of strategic investments.

These uses of cash were offset by $644.4 million received related to the maturity of investments. Net Cash and Cash Equivalents Provided by Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted primarily of our stock offerings, the various components of our 2025 Notes offering, the various components of our 2022 Notes repayment, the issuance of common stock under our stock plans, payments of employee taxes related to the net share settlement of stock-based awards, and repayments of our finance lease obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities consisted of $450.1 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes, $363.6 million of proceeds from the settlement of the Convertible Note Hedges related to the 2022 Notes, and $30.4 million of proceeds related to issuance of common stock under stock plans. This source of cash was offset by $236.0 million used for repayment of the 2022 Notes attributable to the principal, $327.5 million for payment to settle the Warrants related to the 2022 Notes, $50.6 million for payment of the Capped Call Options related to the 2025 Notes, and $7.4 million used for payment of employee taxes related to the net share settlement of stock-based awards.

In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during and as of the reporting periods. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which typically include subscriptions to our online software solutions and professional services which include on-boarding and training services. Our customers do not have the right to take possession of the online software products. Revenue from online software products is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the online software product is made available to customers. We recognize revenue from on-boarding and training services as the services are provided. Amounts billed that have not yet met the applicable revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each good or service. We calculate SSP for each type of online software product and professional service offering by averaging the selling price of all purchases within the trailing four calendar quarters. We use four quarters of transaction data to determine SSP as most of our customer arrangements are one year or less and pricing may be subject to change upon each customer’s renewal. In instances where there are not sufficient data points, or the average selling prices for a particular online software product or professional service offering are disparate, we estimate the SSP using other observable inputs, such as similar products or services. If the actual selling price for the sale of an online software product or professional service offering within a multiple performance obligation arrangement substantially differs from the SSP of that offering, we use the relative SSP to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer Sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental, recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be approximately one to three years. The one to three-year period has been determined by taking into consideration the type of product sold, the commitment term of the customer contract, the nature of the Company’s technology development life-cycle, and an estimated customer relationship period. Sales commissions for upgrade contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated customer relationship period of the related customer. Capitalized Software Development Costs Software development costs consist of certain payroll and stock compensation costs incurred to develop functionality for our CRM Platform and internally-built software platforms, as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are expected to result in enhanced functionality. We capitalize certain software development costs for new offerings as well as upgrades to our existing software platforms, while costs associated with planning new developments and maintaining our CRM Platform software and internally built software platforms are expensed as incurred.. We amortize these development costs over the estimated useful life of two to five years on a straight-line basis. We determined that a two- to five- year life is appropriate for our internal-use software based on our best estimate of the useful life of the internally developed software after considering factors such as continuous developments in the technology, obsolescence, and anticipated life of the service offering before significant upgrades. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a quarterly basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We determine the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by our developers on projects in the application stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating the time allocated to a particular project in the application stage. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods. 53 Leases On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease guidance using a modified retrospective transition method applied to those leases which were not completed as of January 1, 2019. We lease office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through May 2031. Certain leases contain optional termination dates. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and does not separate lease and non-lease components of an arrangement determined to contain a lease. Operating and finance leases with a duration of less than 12 months are excluded from right-of-use-assets and lease liabilities and related expense is recorded as incurred. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of operating lease payments. To determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, we use publicly available credit ratings for peer companies. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments, which requires judgment. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Contractual obligations are cash that we are obligated to pay as part of certain contracts that we have entered during our course of business. Certain of our leases contain optional termination dates. The table below only includes payments up to the optional termination date. If we were to extend leases beyond the optional termination date, the future commitments would increase by approximately $90.8 million. Below is a table that shows the projected outlays as of December 31, 2020: Payments due in: Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Operating leases obligations 388,962 51,933 100,443 97,303 139,283 Vendor commitments 102,397 31,138 71,259 — — Total $ 491,359 $ 83,071 $ 171,702 $ 97,303 $ 139,283 Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $3.4 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above, are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until 2029. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2020 or 2019 exclusive of items described above and indemnifications of officers, directors and employees for certain events or occurrences while the officer, director or employee is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information on recent accounting pronouncements, see Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 54 ITEM 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Australian dollar, Singaporean dollar, Japanese Yen, and Colombian Peso. Since we translate foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We recognized immaterial amounts of foreign currency gains and losses in each of the periods presented. We have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as we expand our international operation, and our risk grows. Interest Rate Sensitivity Our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments is maintained in a variety of securities, including government agency obligations, corporate bonds and money market funds. Investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and carried at their fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. A sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio. We do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Inflation Risk We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business. However, if our costs, in particular personnel, sales and marketing and hosting costs, were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In May 2017, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior due June 1, 2022, of which $272.1 million was repurchased in June 2020 and $2 million was settled in cash in the fourth quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $125.8 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2022 Notes. Also in June 2020, we issued $460 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due June 1, 2025. The fair value of our convertible senior notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines in value. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our convertible senior notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Generally, the fair values of 2022 Notes and the 2025 Notes (the “Notes”) will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Additionally, we carry the convertible senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10% changes of our stock price as of December 31, 2020 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the Notes. The selected scenarios are not predictions of future events, but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such event may have on the fair value of the Notes. 2022 Notes Hypothetical change in HubSpot stock price Fair value Estimated change in fair value Hypothetical percentage increase (decrease) in fair value 10% increase $ 577,631 $ 50,480 10 % No change $ 527,151 $ — — 10% decrease $ 472,359 $ (54,792 ) (10 )% 55 2025 Notes Hypothetical change in HubSpot stock price Fair value Estimated change in fair value Hypothetical percentage increase (decrease) in fair value 10% increase $ 794,047 $ 75,240 10 % No change $ 718,807 $ — — 10% decrease $ 679,664 $ (39,143 ) (5 )% 56 ITEM 8.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HubSpot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 58 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Capitalized software development costs – estimate of time and related costs eligible for capitalization As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated capitalized software development costs, net balance was $24.9 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company capitalizes certain software development costs for new offerings as well as upgrades to existing software platforms. Management determines the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by developers on projects in the application stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating time allocated to a particular project in the application stage. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the estimate of time and related costs eligible for capitalization as capitalized software development costs is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the amount of time to capitalize for projects; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determination of capitalized costs and management’s judgment related to the amount of time incurred by developers on projects in the application stage. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to capitalized software development costs, including controls over management’s estimate of time and related costs eligible for capitalization. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the time and related costs eligible for capitalization in the current year, (ii) evaluating whether the time and related costs were eligible for capitalization, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in management’s estimate of eligible time and related costs, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management in estimating eligible time and related costs. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to eligible software development time for capitalization involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) inquiries with management and IT product development managers in evaluating the software development costs capitalized for a sample of capitalized projects, and (ii) evaluating management’s estimate of hours through inquiry with a sample of individual software developers regarding the nature, timing and extent of time worked on development activities. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 16, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016. 59 HUBSPOT, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization and Operations HubSpot, Inc. (the “Company”) provides a cloud-based CRM Platform, that enables companies to attract, engage, and delight customers throughout the customer experience. The Company’s CRM Platform, comprised of Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, and a CMS Hub features integrated applications and tools that enable businesses to create a cohesive and adaptable customer experience. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a global pandemic (the “pandemic”). The Company has assessed the impact of the pandemic, and while the broader implications of the pandemic on the results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain, the Company assessed the potential impact on the December 31, 2020 financial statements and determined there were no material adjustments necessary with respect to these consolidated financial statements. Given that the economic consequences of the pandemic have been exceptionally challenging for many customers, in March 2020, the Company implemented certain changes to pricing and packaging, including reducing prices on certain products and offering certain product functionality free of charge for a limited time. The Company also made a one-time payment to certain Solutions Partners for six months of commissions in advance of them being earned. While revenue, customer retention, and earnings are relatively predictable under a subscription-based business model, the potential effect of the pandemic will not be fully reflected in the results of operations and overall financial performance of the Company until future periods given the current macro-economic uncertainty. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law by the United States. The CARES Act provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended to address the impact of the pandemic, including tax relief and government loans, grants, and investments. In June 2020, the Jobs Support Scheme (“JSS”) was announced by the Singapore government to provide support to employers and help enterprises retain their local employees during the pandemic. The CARES Act and the JSS did not have a material impact with respect to these consolidated financial statements. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation —The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates —The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating Segments —The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is the Company’s chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Loss Per Share — Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase common stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), shares issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), the Warrants (defined below), the Conversion Option of the 2022 Notes, and the Conversion Option of the 2025 Notes (the “Conversion Options”) (Note 9) are considered to be potential common stock equivalents. 66 A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net loss $ (85,031 ) $ (53,746 ) $ (63,828 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding—basic 44,757 42,025 38,529 Dilutive effect of share equivalents resulting from stock options, RSUs, ESPP, Warrants and the Conversion Options — — — Weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted 44,757 42,025 38,529 Net loss per common share, basic and diluted $ (1.90 ) $ (1.28 ) $ (1.66 ) Since the Company incurred net losses for each of the periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share. All of the Company’s outstanding stock options, RSUs, and shares issuable under the ESPP, as well as the Warrants and Conversion Options were excluded in the calculation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. The Company expects to settle the principal amount of the Notes (Note 9) in cash, and therefore, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Warrants and Conversion Options on diluted net income per share, if applicable. As a result, only the amount by which the conversion cost of the Notes, if settled in shares, exceeds the aggregated principal amount of the Notes (the “Conversion Spread”) is considered in the diluted earnings per share computation. The Conversion Spread has a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period of time exceeds the initial conversion price of $94.77 per share for the 2022 Notes and $282.52 for the 2025 Notes. The average stock price for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $240.59. As the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price of $94.77 on each applicable trading day, the 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company settled approximately $2 million of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash. Between the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and February 12, 2021, the Company additionally settled $8.3 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash in response to conversion notices received prior to December 31, 2020. As of February 12, 2021, the Company has received additional conversion notices subsequent to year-end for approximately $36.1 million of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes, which will be settled in cash during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. For disclosure purposes, the potentially dilutive effect of the Conversion Spread is calculated and included in the table below. As the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price of $282.52 on each applicable trading day, the 2025 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2021. As of February 12, 2021, no holders have converted or indicated their intention to convert the 2025 Notes. For disclosure purposes, the potentially dilutive effect of the Conversion Spread is calculated and included in the table below. The following table contains all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Options to purchase common shares 1,020 1,489 1,824 RSUs 1,561 1,207 1,732 Conversion Option of the 2022 Notes and Warrants 1,873 3,104 1,211 Conversion Option of the 2025 Notes 318 — — ESPP 21 2 — Cash and Cash Equivalents — 67 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in bank deposit accounts and short-term, highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, consisting primarily of money-market funds. Investments — Investments consist of commercial paper, corporate debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Securities having remaining maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase and less than one year from the date of the balance sheets are classified as short-term, and those with maturities of more than one year from the date of the balance sheet are classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company classifies its debt investments with readily determinable market values as available-for-sale. These investments are classified as investments on the consolidated balance sheets and are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in nature reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Company reviews all investments for reductions in fair value that are other-than-temporary. When such reductions occur, the cost of the investment is adjusted to fair value through recording a loss on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on investments are calculated on the basis of specific identification. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company periodically evaluates whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors: the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors; overall market conditions and trends and the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. Strategic investments — Strategic investments consist of non-controlling equity investments in privately held companies. These investments without readily determinable fair values for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the non-marketable securities are carried at cost less any impairments, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts — Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the probability of future collection. The probability of future collection is based on specific considerations of historical loss patterns and an assessment of the continuation of such patterns based on past collection trends and known or anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The probability of future collection is also assessed by geography. To date, losses resulting from uncollected receivables have not exceeded management’s expectations. The following is a roll forward of the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands): Balance Beginning of Period Charged to Statement of Operations Deductions (1) Balance at End of Period Allowance for doubtful accounts Year ended December 31, 2020 $ 1,584 $ 8,501 $ (8,092 ) $ 1,993 Year ended December 31, 2019 $ 1,317 $ 7,895 $ (7,628 ) $ 1,584 Year ended December 31, 2018 $ 638 $ 5,514 $ (4,835 ) $ 1,317 (1) Deductions include actual accounts written-off, net of recoveries. Restricted Cash —The Company had restricted cash of $3.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $8.8 million at December 31, 2019 related to letters of credit for it leased facilities. The following table provides a reconciliation of the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 378,123 $ 269,670 Restricted cash, included in other assets 3,029 8,845 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 381,152 $ 278,515 68 Property and Equipment —Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, whereas major betterments are capitalized as additions to leasehold improvements. Depreciation is recorded over the following estimated useful lives: Estimated Useful Life Employee related computer equipment 2 - 3 years Computer equipment and purchased software 3 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Internal-use software 5 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or useful life The Company capitalizes certain payroll and stock compensation costs incurred to develop functionality for certain of the Company’s internally built software platforms. The costs incurred during the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once a piece of incremental functionality has reached the development stage certain internal costs are capitalized until the functionality is ready for its intended use. Internal-use software is included within property and equipment on the balance sheet. The costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of approximately five years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets —Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. Management considers the following potential indicators of impairment of its long-lived assets (asset group): a substantial decrease in the Company’s stock price, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the long-lived asset (asset group), an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset (asset group), and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there may be an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. For the years presented, the Company did not recognize an impairment charge. Intangible Assets — Intangible assets consist of acquired technology, trade name and customer relationships. The Company records acquired intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and amortize such assets in a pattern reflective of the expected economic benefits consumption over the expected useful life of the asset. If this pattern cannot be reliably determined, a straight-line amortization method is used. The estimated useful life of acquired technology is two to seven years and is based on the period over which economic benefits will be derived from each acquired intangible asset. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Goodwill —Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is monitored annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. Management considers the following potential indicators of impairment: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the Company’s use of acquired assets or the strategy of the Company’s overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends and a significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period. The Company performs its annual impairment test on November 30. Currently, the Company’s goodwill is evaluated at the entity level as it has been determined there is one operating segment comprised of one reporting unit. When assessing goodwill for impairment the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. If the Company determines it is unlikely that the reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying value then no quantitative assessment is performed. If the Company cannot determine that it is likely that the reporting unit fair value is more than its carrying value, then the Company performs a quantitative assessment. Based on the qualitative assessment performed on November 30, 2020, the Company determined it was unlikely that it’s reporting unit fair value was less than its carrying value and no quantitative assessment was required. There were no indicators that the Company’s goodwill had become impaired since that date, and as such, there was no impairment of goodwill as of November 30, 2020 or December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not recognize an impairment charge. Business Combinations — The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as acquired assets and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations are based on, among other factors, estimates 69 of future expected cash flows attributable to the acquired intangible assets and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Advertising Expense —The Company expenses advertising as incurred, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred $21.9 million of advertising expense in 2020, $14.9 million in 2019, and $8.4 million in 2018. Leases — On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease guidance using a modified retrospective transition method applied to those leases which were not completed as of January 1, 2019. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and does not separate lease and non-lease components of an arrangement determined to contain a lease. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Operating and finance leases with a duration of less than 12 months are excluded from right-of-use-assets and operating lease liabilities and related expense is recorded as incurred. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The lease ROU asset includes any initial direct costs incurred and is reduced for tenant incentives. As the Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. To determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, the Company uses publicly available credit ratings for peer companies. The Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance leases use the effective interest method to record expense which results in a front-loaded expense recognition pattern. Asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) On the lease commencement date the Company establishes an ARO based on the present value of contractually required estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. The asset associated with the ARO is amortized over the corresponding lease term to operating expense and the ARO is accreted to the end of lease obligation value over the same term. Revenue Recognition — The Company generates revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which typically include subscriptions to its online software products and professional services which include on-boarding and training services. The Company’s customers do not have the right to take possession of the online software products. The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below: • Identify the customer contract; • Identify performance obligations that are distinct; • Determine the transaction price; • Allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and • Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. 70 Identify the customer contract A customer contract is generally identified when the Company and a customer have executed an arrangement that calls for the Company to grant access to its online software products and provide professional services in exchange for consideration from the customer. Identify performance obligations that are distinct A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and a company’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company has determined that subscriptions for its online software products are distinct because, once a customer has access to the online software product that it purchased, the online software product is fully functional and does not require any additional development, modification, or customization. Professional services sold are distinct because the customer benefits from the on-boarding and training to make better use of the online software products it purchased. Determine the transaction price The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies. The Company estimates any variable consideration to which it will be entitled at contract inception, and reassesses at each reporting date, when determining the transaction price. The Company does not include variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will occur when any uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. The Company determines the SSP of its goods and services based upon the average sales prices for each type of online software product and professional services sold. In instances where there are not sufficient data points, or the selling prices for a particular online software product or professional service are disparate, the Company estimates the SSP using other observable inputs, such as similar products or services. Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied Revenues are recognized when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers. Revenue from online software products is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the Company’s online software products are made available to customers. Most subscription contracts are one year or less. The Company recognizes revenue from on-boarding and training services as the services are provided. Cash payments received in advance of providing subscription or services are recorded to deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. Solutions Partner Commissions The Company pays its Solutions Partners a commission based on the online software product sales price for sales to end-customers. The classification of the commission paid in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations depends on who purchases the online software product. In instances where an end-customer purchases from the Company, the commission paid to the Solutions Partner is recorded as sales and marketing expense. When a Solutions Partner purchases from the Company, the commission paid to the Solutions Partner is netted against the associated revenue recognized. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers —Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, investments and accounts receivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large financial institutions. Although the Company's deposits may exceed federally insured limits, the financial institutions that the Company uses have high investment-grade credit ratings and, as a result, the Company believes that, as of December 31, 2020, its risk relating to deposits exceeding federally insured limits was not significant. The Company’s investments consist of highly rated corporate debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company limits the amount of investments in any single issuer, except U.S. Treasuries. The Company believes that, as of December 31, 2020, its concentration of credit risk related to investments was not significant. 71 The Company has no significant off-balance sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other hedging arrangements. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers and generally requires payment 30 days from the invoice date. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. Credit risk arising from accounts receivable is mitigated as a result of transacting with a large number of geographically dispersed customers spread across various industries. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no customers that represented more than 10% of the net accounts receivable balance. There were no customers that individually exceeded 10% of the Company’s revenue in any of the periods presented. Foreign Currency —The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, with the resulting translation adjustments directly recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Income and expense accounts are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other expense. Research and Development —Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits and other expenses associated with product development. Also included is a benefit related to an Irish research and development tax credit, under which the Company is able to obtain a refundable credit of up to 25% of eligible research and development expenses incurred. The credit is recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses in the period in which the eligible expenses are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Capitalized Software Development Costs —Certain payroll and stock compensation costs incurred to develop functionality for the Company’s software and internally built software platforms, as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are expected to result in enhanced functionality are capitalized. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, the Company capitalizes certain software development costs for new offerings as well as upgrades to existing software platforms. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of two to five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a quarterly basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. The Company determines the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by the developers on projects in the application stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating time allocated to a particular project in the application stage. Costs associated with building or significantly enhancing the CRM Platform and internally built software platforms are capitalized, while costs associated with planning new developments and maintaining the CRM Platform software and internally built software platforms are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs, exclusive of those costs recorded within property and equipment, consisted of the following: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Gross capitalized software development costs $ 85,630 $ 61,641 Accumulated amortization (60,687 ) (44,848 ) Capitalized software development costs, net $ 24,943 $ 16,793 Amortization of capitalized software development costs, exclusive of costs recorded within property and equipment, was $16.0 million in 2020, $11.6 million in 2019, and $9.2 million in 2018. Amortization expense is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes —Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements is in accordance with accounting authoritative guidance, which prescribes a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 72 Stock-Based Compensation — The Company accounts for all stock options and awards granted to employees and nonemployees using a fair value method. Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense and is measured at the fair value of the award. The measurement date for awards is generally the date of the grant. For stock options, the Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to measure the fair value of the grant. The fair value of the Company’s common stock is the closing price of the stock on the date of the grant. The expected term of options granted to employees was calculated using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted-average vesting period of the option. The Company considers this appropriate as there is no other method that would be more indicative of exercise activity. The expected volatility for the Company’s common stock was based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of similar public companies. The determine the Company’s peer companies, the following criteria was used: software or software-as-a-service companies; similar histories and relatively comparable financial leverage; sufficient public company trading history; similar talent pool; and in similar businesses and geographical markets. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period for awards, on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements— Recent accounting standards not included below are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2019: On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the lease guidance using a modified retrospective transition method applied to those leases which were not completed as of January 1, 2019. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2018 are presented under the new guidance, while prior period comparative amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historical guidance. The Company applied the new standard using the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance where the Company: • did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts contain a lease; • did not reassess the classification of existing leases; and • did not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. In addition, the Company elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases. The resulting impact, as of the adoption date, to the consolidated balance sheet of applying the new guidance in 2019 versus the prior guidance was an increase to right-of-use assets of $152.2 million, a decrease to other assets of $0.3 million, an increase to total assets of $151.9 million, an increase to short-term lease liabilities of $14.1 million, a decrease to accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $0.5 million, an increase to total current liabilities of $13.5 million, an increase to long-term lease liabilities of $164.8 million, a decrease to deferred rent, net of current portion of $26.4 million and an increase to total liabilities of $151.9 million. There was no impact to stockholders’ equity or the consolidated statements of operations as a result of adopting the new guidance. There was no impact to total operating or financing cash flows of applying the new guidance in 2019 versus the prior guidance other than renaming or adding line items to the statements of cash flows to conform to the accounting for, and presentation of, the new standard. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2020: In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under previous guidance, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test required entities to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The carrying value in excess of the implied fair value was recognized as goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, goodwill impairment is recognized based on Step 1 of the current guidance, which calculates the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. The guidance was adopted effective January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that introduces a new methodology for accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The guidance establishes a new forward-looking ""expected loss model"" that requires entities to estimate current expected credit losses on accounts receivable and other financial instruments by using all practical and relevant information. The guidance was adopted effective January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 73 In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the accounting for incomes taxes by removing (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items, (ii) the exception to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment, and (iii) the exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The guidance also improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas accounting for income taxes. The guidance was adopted effective January 1, 2020, using a prospective approach and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted in Future Periods: In August 2020, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being bifurcated from the host contract and separately recognized as compared with current GAAP. In addition, it eliminates the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the standard on its consolidated financial statements. 3. Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue The Company provides disaggregation of revenue based on geographic region (Note 10) and based on the subscription versus professional services and other classification on the consolidated statements of operations as it believes these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Deferred Revenue and Deferred Commission Expense Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue, and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term deferred revenue. Deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $82.4 million resulting from $965.4 million of calculated billings and was offset by revenue recognized of $883.0 million during the same period. $232.0 million of revenue was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $255.6 million of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for contracts with original performance obligations that exceed one year. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 93% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, with the balance recognized thereafter. Additional contract liabilities $1.7 million and $1.4 million were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which primarily consist of sales commissions paid for new subscription contracts, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of approximately one to three years. The one to three-year period has been determined by taking into consideration the type of product sold, the commitment term of the customer contract, the nature of the Company’s technology development life-cycle, and an estimated customer relationship period. Sales commissions for upgrade contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated customer relationship period of the related customer. Deferred commission expense that will be recorded as expense during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred commission expense, and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term deferred commission expense. Deferred commission expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $21.7 million as a result of deferring incremental costs of obtaining a contract of $65.6 million and was offset by amortization of $43.9 million during the same period. 4. Leases The Company leases office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through May 2031. Operating lease expense costs were $44.6 million in 2020 and $32.2 million in 2019. The Company subleases some of its unused spaces to third parties. Operating sublease income generated under all operating lease agreements for the year ended 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 74 Year ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Operating sublease income $ 5,000 $ 2,498 The following table provides a reconciliation between non-cancelable lease commitments and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020: Operating leases Lease commitments (Note 11) $ 388,962 Less: Legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced — Less: Present value discount (79,469 ) Total lease liabilities $ 309,493 Certain leases contain optional termination dates, and the Company is not reasonably certain to extend its lease agreements beyond those dates. The Company evaluates whether it will extend these lease agreements each reporting period and updates its lease liabilities accordingly. If the Company were to extend leases beyond the optional termination date, the future commitments would increase by approximately $90.8 million. Lease Term and Discount Rate The Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of operating lease payments. To determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, the Company uses publicly available credit ratings for peer companies. The Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments. The following table provides weighted average remaining lease terms and weighted average discount rate for operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2020: Weighted-average remaining lease term: 8.0 years Weighted-average discount rate: 5.3% Other Information Cash payments related to operating lease liabilities were $48.8 million in 2020 and $28.8 million in 2019. 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company measures certain financial assets at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. 75 The following table details the fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 : December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in thousands) Cash equivalents and investments: Money market funds $ 172,485 $ — $ — $ 172,485 Commercial paper — 12,233 — 12,233 Corporate bonds — 116,371 — 116,371 U.S. Treasury securities — 774,772 — 774,772 Certificates of deposit — 394 — 394 Restricted cash: Money market funds — 3,029 — 3,029 Total $ 172,485 $ 906,799 $ — $ 1,079,284 December 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (in thousands) Cash equivalents and investments: Money market funds $ 96,618 $ — $ — $ 96,618 Commercial paper — 87,185 — 87,185 Corporate bonds — 87,138 — 87,138 U.S. Treasury securities — 631,174 — 631,174 Restricted cash: Certificates of deposit — 5,816 — 5,816 Money market funds — 3,029 — 3,029 Total $ 96,618 $ 814,342 $ — $ 910,960 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The fair value of the Company’s investments in certain money market funds is their face value and such instruments are classified as Level 1 and are included in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (within other long-term assets) on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Level 2 securities were priced by pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the 2022 Notes was $526.1 million and the fair value of the 2025 Notes was $718.8 million (Note 9). The fair value was determined based on the quoted price of the 2022 and 2025 Notes in an inactive market on the last trading day of the reporting period and has been classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, finance leases and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these balances. Restricted cash is comprised of money market funds and certificates of deposit related to landlord guarantees for leased facilities. These restricted cash balances have been excluded from our cash and cash equivalents balance on our consolidated balance sheets. Strategic investments consist of non-controlling equity investments in privately held companies. The Company elected the measurement alternative for these investments without readily determinable fair values and for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method of accounting, the non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost less any impairment, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, which is recorded within the statement of operations. The Company holds $6.7 million of strategic investments without readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2020 and $4.4 million of strategic investments without readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2019. These investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment of $250 thousand and there have been no adjustments to the carrying value of the strategic investments in 2019 or 2018. 76 The following tables summarize the composition of our short- and long-term investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019: December 31, 2020 Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Aggregate Fair Value (in thousands) Commercial paper $ 12,233 $ — $ — $ 12,233 Corporate bonds 115,983 427 (39 ) 116,371 U.S. Treasury securities 774,667 105 — 774,772 Certificates of deposit 394 — — 394 Total $ 903,277 $ 532 $ (39 ) $ 903,770 December 31, 2019 Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Aggregate Fair Value (in thousands) Commercial paper $ 77,214 $ — $ — $ 77,214 Corporate bonds 86,900 251 (13 ) 87,138 U.S. Treasury securities 581,066 207 (15 ) 581,258 Total $ 745,180 $ 458 $ (28 ) $ 745,610 For all of our securities for which the amortized cost basis was greater than the fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has concluded that there is no plan to sell the security nor is it more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. In making the determination as to whether the unrealized loss is other-than-temporary, the Company considered the length of time and extent the investment has been in an unrealized loss position, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, the issuers’ credit rating and the time to maturity. Contractual Maturities The contractual maturities of short-term and long-term investments held as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Amortized Cost Basis Aggregate Fair Value Amortized Cost Basis Aggregate Fair Value ( in thousands) Due within one year $ 872,637 $ 873,073 $ 691,556 $ 691,834 Due after 1 year and within 2 years 30,640 30,697 53,624 53,776 Total $ 903,277 $ 903,770 $ 745,180 $ 745,610 6. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following: December 31. 2020 2019 (in thousands) Computer equipment and purchased software $ 15,128 $ 13,028 Employee related computer equipment 20,802 13,829 Furniture and fixtures 20,204 14,319 Leasehold improvements 89,850 56,618 Equipment under finance lease 3,450 3,450 Internal-use software 12,528 7,770 Construction in progress 10,014 23,714 Total property and equipment 171,976 132,728 Less accumulated depreciation (70,853 ) (49,079 ) Property and equipment, net $ 101,123 $ 83,649 77 Depreciation and amortization expense was $20.6 million in 2020, $15.0 million in 2019, and $12.9 million in 2018. The Company capitalized asset retirement costs of $4.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $3.3 million at December 31, 2019 within leasehold improvements and the related liability is within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These costs represent future lease restoration obligations as required by Company’s leases. The changes in the asset retirement obligation balance during the year ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Beginning balance $ 3,533 $ 1,424 Additions 750 2,028 Accretion 236 103 Updates to estimated cash flows 365 (22 ) Ending balance $ 4,884 $ 3,533 7. Business Acquisitions On October 31, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of PieSync, a Belgian-based technology company that operates an integration platform as a service (“iPaaS”) solution which continuously syncs customer data bi-directionally across various software applications. PieSync is one of the only iPaaS technologies that provides both a current and historical two-way sync of customer data that operates in the background, which will offer customers a more efficient way of managing multiple applications. The total cash purchase price for the acquisition was $23.3 million, net of cash acquired, which includes a working capital settlement of $0.3 million. Other liabilities assumed includes $333 thousand of debt, which the Company repaid in 2019. There was approximately $2.7 million of potential consideration that was not included in the purchase price allocation as it is not associated with pre-combination services. This potential additional payment is contingent upon post-acquisition employment and will be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations over a period of 2 years. Through December 31, 2020, $1.6 million of this consideration had been earned and recorded as operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The transaction costs associated with the acquisition were approximately $527 thousand and were recorded in general and administrative expense. The following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition: Fair value (in thousands) Cash $ 646 Accounts receivable 133 Other current and noncurrent assets 218 Acquired developed technology 9,800 Other intangible assets 70 Goodwill 15,219 Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities (731 ) Deferred revenue (210 ) Deferred tax liability (1,324 ) Total purchase price $ 23,821 The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company will derive significant value from this acquisition through synergies such as cross selling opportunities and a stronger platform that offers a suite of products not directly matched by competitors. The goodwill recognized is not deductible for foreign income tax purposes. The Company applied variations of the income approach to estimate the fair values of the intangible assets acquired. The primary intangible asset acquired in the business combination was developed technology and the fair value of the developed technology of $9.8 million was determined based on the estimated present value of expected after-tax cash flows attributable to the technology using an excess earnings method. The Company applied significant estimates and assumptions with respect to forecasted 78 revenue growth rates, the revenue attributable to the acquired intangible asset over its estimated economic life, and the discount rate. The fair values assigned to the other tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination were based on management’s estimates and assumptions. The Company began amortizing the acquired technology on the date of acquisition. The acquired technology is being amortized over seven years using a method reflective of the expected economic benefit consumption over the expected useful life of the asset. The weighted average amortization period for the acquired technology is approximately 4.3 years. The amortization expense is recorded to cost of subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has included the operating results of PieSync, which are not material, in its consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. The acquisition did not have a material effect on the revenue or earnings in the consolidated income statement for the reporting periods presented. The pro forma results of the Company as if the acquisition had taken place on the first day of 2018 were not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 8. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Intangible assets acquired through business combinations Intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consist of the following: Weighted Average Remaining Useful Life December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Acquired technology 40 Months $ 18,383 $ 17,297 Other intangible assets 9 Months 70 70 Accumulated amortization (8,171 ) (5,615 ) Total $ 10,282 $ 11,752 Other intangible assets include trade name and customer relationship. The estimated useful life of acquired technology is two to seven years. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $2.6 million in 2020, $3.2 million in 2019, and $1.4 million in 2018. Amortization expense of acquired technology is included in cost of subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Estimated future amortization expense for intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 is as follows: Years ended December 31, Amortization Expense (in thousands) 2021 $ 1,083 2022 1,406 2023 1,844 2024 2,150 2025 2,126 Thereafter 1,673 Total $ 10,282 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net assets acquired and is generally not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually. 79 The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill consist of the following: (in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 14,950 PieSync acquisition 15,219 Effect of foreign currency translation 81 Balance as of December 31, 2019 30,250 Effect of foreign currency translation 1,431 Measurement period adjustments (363 ) Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 31,318 9. Convertible Senior Notes 2025 Convertible Senior Notes and Capped Call Options In June 2020, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 0.375% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) in a private offering and an additional $60 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment options of the initial purchasers. The interest rate is fixed at 0.375% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The total net proceeds from the debt offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $450.1 million. Each $1,000 of principal amount of the 2025 Notes will initially be convertible into 3.5396 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion Option of the 2025 Notes”), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $282.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. On or after March 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2025 Notes at any time. The 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2025 under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2025 Notes (the “Indenture”). Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. The Company expects to settle the principal amount of the 2025 Notes in cash. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change prior to the maturity date, holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2025 Notes called for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as permitted by the Indenture. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the conditions allowing holders of the 2025 Notes to convert have not been met and are therefore not convertible during the year ended December 31, 2020. Because the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2025 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. As of February 12, 2021, no holders have converted or indicated their intention to convert the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are classified as long-term debt. In accounting for the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the Conversion Option was $98.7 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes. The equity component is recorded in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (the ""Debt Discount"") is amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 5.71% over the contractual term of the 2025 Notes. In accounting for the debt issuance costs of $9.9 million related to the 2025 Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2025 Notes based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were $7.8 million and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of the 2025 Notes. Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were $2.1 million and are netted with the equity component of the 2025 Notes in stockholders’ equity. The difference in the book and tax allocation between the liability and equity components of the 2025 Notes resulted in a difference between the carrying amount and tax basis of the 2025 Notes. This taxable temporary difference resulted in the Company 80 recognizing a deferred tax liability and a corresponding reduction in the Company's valuation allowance on its US deferred tax assets, resulting in no net deferred tax impact. The net carrying amount of the liability component of the 2025 Notes is as follows: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Principal $ 460,000 $ — Unamortized debt discount (88,756 ) — Unamortized issuance costs (6,973 ) — Net carrying amount $ 364,271 $ — The net carrying amount of the equity component of the 2025 Notes is as follows: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Debt discount for conversion option $ 98,730 $ — Issuance costs (2,120 ) — Net carrying amount $ 96,610 $ — Interest expense related to the 2025 Notes is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Contractual interest expense $ 987 $ — $ — Amortization of debt discount 9,974 — — Amortization of issuance costs 784 — — Total interest expense $ 11,745 $ — $ — In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, the Company purchased capped call options (“Capped Call Options”) with respect to its common stock for $50.6 million. The Capped Call Options are purchased call options that give the Company the option to purchase up to approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $282.52 per share, which corresponds to the approximate initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes. The Capped Call Options were purchased in order to offset potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 2025 Notes, subject to a cap of $426.44 per share, and expire concurrently with the 2025 Notes. The Capped Call Options automatically settle in components commencing on April 16, 2025 and are subject to either adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including a merger event; a tender offer; and a nationalization, insolvency or delisting involving the Company. In addition, the Capped Call Options are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Call Options, including changes in law, insolvency filings, and hedging disruptions. Since the transaction meets certain accounting criteria, the $50.6 million paid for the Capped Call Options is recorded in stockholders’ equity as a reduction in additional paid-in capital and are not accounted for as separate derivative financial instruments. 2022 Convertible Senior Notes, Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant In May 2017, the Company issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) in a private offering and an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of such notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment options of the initial purchasers of the 2022 Notes. The interest rate is fixed at 0.25% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The total net proceeds from the debt offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $389.2 million. Each $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes are currently convertible into 10.5519 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion Option of the 2022 Notes”), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $94.77 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. On or after February 1, 2022 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time. The 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 1, 2022 under certain circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. The Company expects to settle the principal amount of the 2022 Notes in cash. Because the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2020 was equal to or greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day, the 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company settled $2 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash. Between the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and February 12, 2021, the Company additionally settled $8.3 million of principal balance of the 2022 Notes in cash in response to conversion notices received prior to December 31, 2020. As of February 12, 2021, the Company has received additional conversion notices subsequent to year-end for approximately $36.1 million of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes, which will be settled in cash during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. 81 The 2022 Notes are classified as long-term debt, except for $7.8 million classified as current as of December 31, 2020 for conversion notices received prior to year-end, for which the principal amount is expected to be cash-settled within the next fiscal quarter. The equity component of the 2022 Notes will continue to be classified as additional paid-in capital because the Company has the option to settle the principal amount in shares and the maturity date of the 2022 Notes is more than 12 months away. However, it is the Company’s intent to settle the principal amount of the 2022 Notes in cash. In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Convertible Note Hedges”) with certain counterparties in which the Company has the option to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) up to approximately 4.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of approximately $94.77 per share. The Convertible Note Hedges will be settled in cash or shares, or any combination thereof, in accordance with the settlement method of the 2022 Notes in excess of the par amount, and are expected to settle concurrently with the conversion of the 2022 Notes. The total cost of the Convertible Note Hedges was $78.9 million. In addition, the Company sold warrants (the “Warrants”) to certain bank counterparties whereby the holders of the Warrants have the option to initially purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 4.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $115.8 per share. The amount by which the settlement price exceeds the strike price may be settled in shares or cash at the Company’s election. The Warrants are expected to settle three business days from each trading day commencing on September 1, 2022 and ending on the 79th trading day thereafter. The Company received $58.9 million in cash proceeds, net of issuance costs of $200 thousand, from the sale of these Warrants. The purchase of the Convertible Note Hedges and the sale of Warrants is intended to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $94.77 to $115.83 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the net $20.0 million paid for the Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants is recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as separate derivative financial instruments. In June 2020, the Company used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes for the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes, which consisted of a repurchase of $272.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $283.0 in cash and approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock at $207.17 per share. Of the $613.5 million in aggregate consideration, $248.7 million was allocated to the fair value of the debt component of the repurchase, and $364.8 million was allocated to the equity component (the associated Conversion Option of the 2022 Notes) of the repurchases, utilizing a discount rate of 4.9% to determine the fair value of the liability component. This rate was based on the Company’s estimated borrowing rate for a similar liability with the same maturity, but without the associated conversion option. To derive this effective discount rate, the Company utilized observable market rates for liabilities with similar estimated credit characteristics. As of the partial repurchase date, the carrying value of the 2022 Notes subject to the 2022 Notes partial repurchase, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, was $238.2 million. The 2022 Notes partial repurchase and issuance of the 2025 Notes were deemed to have substantially different terms due to the significant difference between the value of the conversion option immediately prior to and after the exchange, and accordingly, the 2022 Notes partial repurchase was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The 2022 Notes partial repurchase resulted in a $10.5 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, which is recorded within interest expense on the Company’s statements of operations. The loss on extinguishment was determined by comparing the consideration attributed to the fair value of the debt component with the carrying value of the debt component, which includes the proportionate amounts of unamortized debt discount and the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes, the consideration allocated to the equity component of $364.8 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company also reversed a corresponding portion of the associated deferred tax liability and increased the Company’s valuation allowance on its US deferred tax assets, resulting in no net deferred tax impact. As of December 31, 2020, $125.8 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2022 Notes. In connection with the partial repurchase of the 2022 Notes, the Company terminated Convertible Note Hedges corresponding to approximately 2.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for cash consideration of $362.5 million, and certain counterparties terminated Warrants corresponding to approximately 2.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for cash consideration of $327.6 million. The net proceeds of $34.9 million received from these transactions were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2020, Convertible Note Hedges giving the Company the option to purchase approximately 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock and Warrants giving certain counterparties the option to acquire up to 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock remain outstanding. 82 The net carrying amount of the liability component of the 2022 Notes is as follows: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Principal $ 125,839 $ 399,992 Unamortized debt discount (10,397 ) (55,299 ) Unamortized issuance costs (777 ) (4,129 ) Net carrying amount $ 114,665 $ 340,564 The net carrying amount of the equity component of the 2022 Notes is as follows: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Debt discount for conversion option $ 33,349 106,006 Issuance costs (898 ) (2,854 ) Net carrying amount $ 32,451 $ 103,152 Interest expense related to the 2022 Notes is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Contractual interest expense $ 614 $ 1,000 $ 1,000 Amortization of debt discount 13,150 20,277 18,923 Amortization of issuance costs 982 1,513 1,412 Total interest expense $ 14,746 $ 22,790 $ 21,335 The net equity impact, included in additional paid-in capital, of the above components of the 2022 Notes is as follows: (in thousands) Conversion Option $ (364,835 ) Issuance of common stock for repayment of 2022 Notes 330,497 Proceeds from settlements of Convertible Note Hedges 362,492 Payments for settlement of Warrants (327,543 ) Total $ 611 10. Segment Information and Geographic Data As more fully described in the Company’s Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company operates in one operating segment. Revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region, based on physical location of the operations recording the sale or the assets are as follows: Revenues by geographical region: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (In thousands) Americas $ 568,365 $ 456,568 $ 361,136 Europe 243,811 168,452 117,670 Asia Pacific 70,850 49,840 34,174 Total $ 883,026 $ 674,860 $ 512,980 Percentage of revenues generated outside of the Americas 36 % 32 % 30 % Revenue derived from customers outside the United States (international) was approximately 43% of total revenue in 2020, 40% of total revenue in 2019 and 37% of total revenue in 2018. 83 Total long-lived assets by geographical region: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 (In thousands) Americas $ 206,789 $ 175,821 Europe 159,338 127,395 Asia Pacific 10,889 14,823 Total long lived assets $ 377,016 $ 318,039 Percentage of long lived assets held outside of the Americas 45 % 45 % 11. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases its office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through May 2031. Rent expense for non-cancellable operating leases with free rental periods or scheduled rent increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Improvement reimbursements from landlords of $21.8 million are being amortized on a straight-line basis into rent expense over the terms of the corresponding leases. Certain leases contain optional termination dates. The table below only includes payments up to the optional termination date. If the Company were to extended leases beyond the optional termination date the future commitments would increase by approximately $90.8 million. Future minimum payments under all operating lease agreements as of December 31, 2020, are as follows: Operating (in thousands) 2021 $ 51,933 2022 50,449 2023 49,994 2024 48,617 2025 48,686 Thereafter 139,283 Total $ 388,962 The Company has entered into certain non-cancelable arrangements (“Vendor Commitments”), which require the future purchase of goods or services.

Legal Contingencies From time to time the Company may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that 84 the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 12. Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is reported as a component of stockholders’ equity, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Cumulative Translation Adjustment Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Total (in thousands) Beginning balance at January 1, 2019 $ (397 ) $ (326 ) $ (723 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications (213 ) 600 387 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — — — Ending balance at December 31, 2019 $ (610 ) $ 274 $ (336 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 4,790 149 4,939 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — — — Ending balance at December 31, 2020 $ 4,180 $ 423 $ 4,603 13. Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-Based Compensation Common Stock Reserved — As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has authorized 500 million shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock reserved for the vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and exercise of common stock options are as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 RSUs 1,561 1,529 Common stock options 1,020 1,494 2,581 3,023 For shares reserved for issuance for the Conversion Options, Warrants and Capped Call Options of the Notes, see Note 9. Equity Incentive Plan —The Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”) was terminated in connection with the IPO, and accordingly, no shares are available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan will continue to govern outstanding awards granted thereunder, the 2007 Plan provided for the grant of qualified incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options or other awards such as RSUs to the Company’s employees, officers, directors and outside consultants. The term of each option is fixed by the Company’s compensation committee and may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2020, 472 thousand options to purchase common stock and no RSUs remained outstanding under the 2007 Plan. On September 25, 2014, the Company’s board of directors adopted and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The 2014 Plan became effective upon the closing of the Company’s IPO in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company initially reserved 1,973,551 shares of its common stock, or the Initial Limit, for the issuance of awards under the 2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the plan automatically increases each January 1, by 5% of the outstanding number of shares of the Company’s common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares as determined by the compensation committee. This number is subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Company’s capitalization. The term of each option is fixed by the Company’s compensation committee and may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2020, 549 thousand options to purchase common stock and 1.6 million RSUs remained outstanding under the 2014 Plan. Equity Compensation Expense —The Company’s equity compensation expense is comprised of awards of options to purchase common stock, RSUs, and stock issued under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). 85 The following two tables show stock compensation expense by award type and where the stock compensation expense is recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 ( in thousands) Options $ 6,377 $ 5,078 $ 5,108 ESPP 6,850 4,866 2,833 RSUs 108,261 87,810 68,320 Total stock-based compensation $ 121,488 $ 97,754 $ 76,261 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Cost of revenue, subscription $ 4,408 $ 3,127 $ 1,476 Cost of revenue, service 2,536 2,829 2,924 Research and development 39,366 33,748 23,328 Sales and marketing 50,552 36,599 31,099 General and administrative 24,626 21,451 17,434 Total stock-based compensation $ 121,488 $ 97,754 $ 76,261 Excluded from stock-based compensation expense is $3.6 million of capitalized software development costs in 2020, $2.4 million in 2019, and $2.4 million in 2018. Stock Options —The fair value of employee options is estimated on the date of each grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.47-1.66 1.95-2.55 2.62-2.85 Expected term (years) 5.50-6.24 5.50-6.02 5.06-6.42 Volatility (%) 38.15-40.63 39.46-41.41 41.34-43.55 Expected dividends — — — The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted was $70.98 per share in 2020, $69.44 per share in 2019, and $51.48 per share in 2018. The interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate at the date of grant with a maturity approximately equal to the expected term. The expected term of options granted to employees was calculated using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted-average vesting period of the option. The expected volatility for the Company’s common stock was based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of similar public companies. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures of share-based awards prior to vesting results in a reversal of previously recorded stock-compensation expense associated with such forfeited awards. The fair value of the Company’s common stock is the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows: Options (in thousands) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Life (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding—January 1, 2020 1,494 $ 33.09 4.0 $ 187,398 Granted 111 183.25 Exercised (580 ) 17.16 Forfeited/expired (5 ) 145.4 Outstanding—December 31, 2020 1,020 57.98 4.4 $ 345,144 Options vested or expected to vest—December 31, 2020 1,020 $ 57.98 4.4 $ 345,144 Options exercisable—December 31, 2020 828 $ 34.85 3.5 $ 299,266 86 Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested options was $9.8 million at December 31, 2020. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years as of December 31, 2020. Restricted Stock Units —RSUs vest upon achievement of a service condition. The service condition is a time-based condition met over a period of four years, with 25% met after one year, and then in equal monthly or quarterly installments over the succeeding three years, or over a period of four years, with equal quarterly installments over those four years. As soon as practicable following each vesting date, the Company will issue to the holder of the RSUs the number of shares of common stock equal to the aggregate number of RSUs that have vested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, in lieu of issuing shares of common stock to the holder of the RSUs, pay the holder an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such shares of common stock. . The total stock-based compensation expense expected to be recorded over the remaining life of outstanding RSUs is approximately $213.4 million at December 31, 2020. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. As of December 31, 2020, there are 1.6 million RSUs expected to vest with an aggregate intrinsic value of $618.5 million. The total fair value of RSUs vested was approximately $101.2 million in 2020, $85.2 million in 2019, and $65.0 million in 2018. The following table summarizes the activity related to RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020: RSUs Outstanding Shares (in thousands) Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Unvested and outstanding at January 1, 2020 1,529 $ 119.46 Granted 1,035 169.79 Vested (880 ) 115.01 Canceled (123 ) 137.73 Unvested and outstanding at December 31, 2020 1,561 $ 153.91 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)— The ESPP authorizes the issuance of up to a total of 2,005,274 shares of common stock to participating employees and allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from the fair market value of the stock as determined on specific dates at six-month intervals. The offering periods for the ESPP commence on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The fair value of employee options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.14-1.60 2.56 1.61-2.10 Expected term (years) 0.50 0.50 0.42-0.50 Volatility (%) 34.75-67.22 41.32-45.07 28.45-28.81 Expected dividends — — — The interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate at the date of grant with a maturity approximately equal to the expected term. The expected term is based on the offering period. The expected volatility for the Company’s common stock was based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of similar public companies. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The fair value of the Company’s common stock is the closing price of the stock on the date the offering period starts. The following table summarizes the activity related to ESPP: Shares Issued (in thousands) Weighted- Average Purchase Price Total Cash Proceeds (in thousands) 2020 132 $ 149.23 $ 19,653 2019 116 $ 123.69 $ 14,383 2018 148 $ 80.21 $ 11,863 87 14. Income Taxes Loss before provision for income taxes was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) United States $ (96,555 ) $ (63,200 ) $ (69,769 ) Foreign 15,740 12,427 7,809 Total $ (80,815 ) $ (50,773 ) $ (61,960 ) The (provision) benefit for income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Current income tax provision Federal $ (406 ) $ (238 ) $ (184 ) State (487 ) (241 ) (140 ) Foreign (5,508 ) (3,293 ) (1,508 ) Total current income tax provision (6,401 ) (3,772 ) (1,832 ) Deferred income tax benefit Federal (116 ) 160 21 State — — — Foreign 2,301 639 (57 ) Total deferred income tax benefit (expense) 2,185 799 (36 ) Total income tax provision $ (4,216 ) $ (2,973 ) $ (1,868 ) The following reconciles the differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the provision for income taxes: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Expected income tax benefit at the federal statutory rate $ 16,899 $ 10,665 $ 12,955 State taxes net of federal benefit 4,618 3,700 5,155 Stock-based compensation 25,196 16,055 17,575 Executive compensation limitation (3,004 ) (7,244 ) — Difference in foreign tax rates 830 693 435 U.S. tax credits 11,529 24,170 1,763 GILTI inclusion — (1,645 ) (1,177 ) Meals and entertainment (478 ) (1,208 ) (1,411 ) Change in valuation allowance (62,182 ) (47,523 ) (37,059 ) Other 2,376 (636 ) (104 ) Income tax benefit (provision) $ (4,216 ) $ (2,973 ) $ (1,868 ) On December 22, 2017, the United States of America signed tax legislation (the “2017 Act”) which enacted a wide range of changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The 2017 Act reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, broadened the tax base and changes rules for expensing and capitalizing business expenditures, established a territorial tax system for foreign earnings as well as a minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, provided for a one-time transition tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings, and introduced new rules for the treatment of certain export sales. In 2020, the Company reversed the 2019 recognized tax benefit under the item-by-item method and recorded a tax expense of $116 thousand. 88 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities —Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 190,555 $ 142,512 Research and investment credits 46,729 35,285 Accruals and reserves 15,278 9,239 Depreciation 2,223 1,756 Intangible assets 164 — Stock-based compensation 7,354 5,451 Interest expense 8,650 3,197 Total deferred tax assets 270,953 197,440 Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets (2,546 ) (2,678 ) Convertible debt (21,873 ) (3,550 ) Capitalized costs (17,009 ) (11,351 ) Depreciation (231 ) (138 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (41,659 ) (17,717 ) Valuation allowance (227,062 ) (180,092 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 2,232 $ (369 ) The Company reviews all available evidence to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including its recent history of accumulated losses over the most recent three years as well as its ability to generate income in future periods. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized given the nature of the assets and the likelihood of future utilization. The valuation allowance increased by $47.0 million in 2020, $47.3 million in 2019 and $36.1 million in 2018, primarily due to the increase in the U.S. net operating loss deferred tax asset. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its valuation allowance positions within the next 12 months. Prior to the 2017 Act, the Company had asserted that the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. In 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the impact of the 2017 Act and determined that it would no longer assert indefinite reinvestment of its foreign earnings. Earnings through December 31, 2017 have been subject to U.S. federal income tax via the one-time transition tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings. The 2017 Act eliminated the U.S. federal income tax cost for qualified repatriation beginning in 2018. The Company has determined that any incremental tax incurred upon ultimate distribution of these earnings to the U.S. would not be material. The Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $760 million and $508 million at December 31, 2020 and $568 million and $379 million at December 31, 2019. The Company also had international net operating loss carryforwards of $8 million at December 31, 2020 and $6 million at December 31, 2019. As a result of the 2017 Act all federal net operating losses, created after January 1, 2018, have an indefinite carryforward period. All federal net operating losses, created before January 1, 2018, are subject to a 20 year carryforward period and will expire at various dates through 2037. State net operating losses will expire at various dates through 2040. The Company has a federal interest expense carryforward of $35.2 million at December 31, 2020, and $13.0 million at December 31, 2019, which have an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had federal research and development credit carryforwards of $31.0 million at December 31, 2020 that expire at various dates through 2040. The Company also has state research and investment tax credit carryforwards of $15.7 million, that expire at various dates through 2035. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in the Company's ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. 89 Uncertain Tax Positions —The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on technical merit. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The following summarizes activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Unrecognized benefit—beginning of the year $ 5,445 $ 3,925 $ 2,725 Gross increases—current period positions 3,003 2,387 1,200 Gross decrease—prior period positions — (867 ) — Unrecognized benefit—end of period $ 8,448 $ 5,445 $ 3,925 All of the gross unrecognized tax benefits represent a reduction to the research and development tax credit carryforward. The gross decrease to prior period positions is a result of the Company completing its documentation of credits generated between 2015 and 2018. All of the unrecognized tax benefits decrease deferred tax assets with a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance. None of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized in the future. The Company has elected to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded through December 31, 2020 because the Company has no tax due because of significant NOL carryforwards. The Company does not expect any significant change in its unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. The Company files tax returns in the United States and various jurisdictions throughout the world where the Company has operations or established a taxable presence. All of the Company’s tax years remain open to examination in the United States, as carryforward attributes generated in past years may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities if they have or will be used in future periods. The Company remains open to examination for varying periods in the other foreign jurisdictions and is routinely examined by various taxing authorities. 15. Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a defined contribution savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers certain employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pretax basis, subject to legal limitations. Total employer contributions were $5.9 million in 2020, $4.8 million in 2019, and $4.0 million in 2018. 16. Subsequent Event On February 8, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding equity securities of Hustle Con Media, Inc. (the “Hustle”) for approximately $20 million. The Hustle is a media company that produces a newsletter, podcast, and premium research content for innovative professionals. 90 17.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2020 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. (b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is included under Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 92 (c) Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. (d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
